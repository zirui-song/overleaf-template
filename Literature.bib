	abstract = {We study the role of borrower accounting quality in debt contracting. Specifically, we examine how accounting quality affects the borrower's choice of private versus public debt market and how the design of debt contracts vary with accounting quality in the two markets. We find that accounting quality affects the choice of the market, with poorer accounting quality borrowers preferring private debt, i.e., bank loans. This is consistent with banks possessing superior information access and processing abilities that reduce adverse selection costs for borrowers. We also find that accounting quality has an economically significant but differential impact on contract design in the two markets consistent with differences in recontracting flexibility across the two markets. In the case of private debt, since there is greater recontracting flexibility, both the price (i.e., interest) and non-price (i.e., maturity and collateral) terms are significantly more stringent for poorer accounting quality borrowers, unlike public debt where only the price terms are more stringent. The impact of accounting quality on interest spreads of public debt is 2.5 times that of the private debt, since the price terms alone reflect the variation in accounting quality.},

	abstract = {Building on contract theory, we argue that ﬁnancial covenants control the conﬂicts of interest between lenders and borrowers via two different mechanisms. Capital covenants control agency problems by aligning debt holder–shareholder interests. Performance covenants serve as trip wires that limit agency problems via the transfer of control to lenders in states where the value of their claim is at risk. Companies trade off these mechanisms. Capital covenants impose costly restrictions on the capital structure, while performance covenants require contractible accounting information to be available. Consistent with these arguments, we ﬁnd that the use of performance covenants relative to capital covenants is positively associated with (1) the ﬁnancial constraints of the borrower, (2) the extent to which accounting information portrays credit risk, (3) the likelihood of contract renegotiation, and (4) the presence of contractual restrictions on managerial actions. Our ﬁndings suggest that accounting-based covenants can improve contracting efﬁciency in two different ways.},

Further, we document that the inﬂuence of DCV on the proportion of the loan retained is conditional on the lead arranger’s reputation, the existence of a credit rating, and the lead arranger’s previous relationships with the same borrower. Finally, we ﬁnd that when loans include performance pricing provisions, the likelihood that the single performance measure used is an accounting ratio, rather than a credit rating, is increasing in DCV.},

Seven academic proxies are significantly associated with only one audit process quality measure, and five have insignificant associations with both practitioner assessments. Overall, the significant associations indicate that practitioners and academics share common ground in identifying low-quality audits.

            Using Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) inspection data from 2006 to 2018, we examine the use of auditor‐employed specialists in audit engagements. First, we find that the use of specialists is increasingly prevalent and related to clients’ size and complex accounting estimates. Second, the use of specialists is positively associated with the incidence of audit process deficiencies (identified by PCAOB inspections) but is not associated with output‐based audit‐quality proxies (restatements or absolute discretionary accruals). Hence, although process deficiencies are more likely to occur in engagements with higher use of specialists, financial reporting quality is not negatively impacted. Third, the use of specialists is positively associated with the likelihood of goodwill impairments and negatively associated with engagement profitability. Finally, cross‐sectional tests suggest that board accounting expertise is a salient condition for more effective use of specialists. Collectively, our findings align with concerns noted by the PCAOB and prior experimental and survey studies. Although specialists assist auditors with the audit of complex estimates, engagements with comparatively high specialist use entail an incremental risk of audit process deficiencies.},

Banks with more uninsured deposits experienced greater equity value declines and stock price risk after the start of 2022 when interest rates rose sharply. Before 2022, these banks also had greater stock price risk, profitability, valuations, executive pay, and exposure to commercial loans than other banks but had similar exposure to securities. To explain these facts, we develop a model where banks better at risk-taking attract large uninsured depositors who have loan demand. Rising interest rates and decreased loan demand reduce lending relationship values, leading to outflows from riskier banks.},

We quantify firms’ compliance costs in terms of their labor spending to adhere to government rules. Using comprehensive establishment-level occupational microdata and occupation-specific task information, we recover the proportion of a firm’s wage bill attributable to employees engaged in regulatory compliance. On average for 2002-14, regulatory costs account for 1.34\% to 3.33\% of a firm’s wage bill, totaling up in 2014 to \$239 billion, and to \$289 billion when adding capital equipment costs. Our findings reveal an inverted-U relation between firms’ regulatory compliance costs and their scale of employment, indicating that firms with approximately 500 employees face compliance costs that are about 40 percent higher as a share of total wages compared to small or large firms. Finally, we develop an instrumental variable methodology to disentangle the influence of regulatory requirements and enforcement in driving firms’ compliance costs.},

Keeping leverage constant while retiring bank debt would expose ﬁrms to a higher risk of ﬁnancial distress; they offset this by reducing total borrowing.

            We examine historical banking crises through the lens of bank equity declines, which cover a broad sample of episodes of banking distress with and without banking panics. To do this, we construct a new data set on bank equity returns and narrative information on banking panics for 46 countries over the period of 1870 to 2016. We find that even in the absence of panics, large bank equity declines are associated with substantial credit contractions and output gaps. Although panics are an important amplification mechanism, our results indicate that panics are not necessary for banking crises to have severe economic consequences. Furthermore, panics tend to be preceded by large bank equity declines, suggesting that panics are the result, rather than the cause, of earlier bank losses. We use bank equity returns to uncover a number of forgotten historical banking crises and create a banking crisis chronology that distinguishes between bank equity losses and panics.},

	abstract = {Existing macroeconomic models focused on bank balance sheet lending are deficient because they do not account for the modern industrial organization of financial intermediation. Utilizing publicly available micro-level lending data, we investigate two increasingly significant margins of adjustment in credit markets: banks’ ability to sell loans and shadow bank activity. These adjustment margins are substantial and vary across time and regions with different incomes. We examine these margins in a parsimonious dynamic quantitative model featuring banks with balance sheet adjustment through loan sales and shadow banks. Using the calibrated model, we illustrate that these margins significantly dampen the immediate contraction following bank capital shock. Recovery is also faster, because profitable loan sales (e.g., securitization) allow banks to build capital faster and because shadow banks pick up lending slack. Failure to account for adjustment margins leads to significant errors when studying policies which rely on financial intermediation pass-through in the level of aggregate lending, its direction, and composition. Our model highlights the tension between bank balance sheet models and data. The model, which forces total lending to depend strongly on bank balance sheet health, must reconcile the weak correlation between bank capital and aggregate lending. These issues can be reconciled with now available data from bank balance sheets, overall bank lending, and aggregate lending, in conjunction with a model of modern financial intermediation.},

            Despite its large and increasing size in the United States and Europe, the private debt (PD) market, compared to the bank and syndicated loan markets, has been researched little. In this paper, we survey U.S. and European investors with private debt assets under management (AuM) of over \$390 billion. These investors are primarily direct lending funds. We ask the general partners (GPs) how they source, select, and evaluate deals; how they think of private debt relative to bank and syndicated loan financing; how they monitor their investments; how they interact with private equity (PE) sponsors; and how they view the future of the market. Respondents provide primarily cash-flow-based loans and believe that they finance companies and leverage levels that banks would not fund. Direct lending funds target unlevered returns that appear high relative to their risk. They use leverage in their funds, but appreciably less than banks and collateralized loan obligation funds (CLOs). They use and negotiate for both financial and negative covenants to monitor their investments. The presence of PE sponsors helps them lend more and craft more effective covenants. U.S. and European funds are similar along many dimensions, but European funds rely less on PE sponsors and compete more with banks. Overall, the private debt market is both different from and shares characteristics with bank loan and syndicated loan markets. (JEL G23, G30, G32)},

            Analyzing hand-collected credit agreements for a sample of middle-market firms over 2010–2015, we find that one-third of all loans are directly extended by nonbank financial intermediaries. Two-thirds of such nonbank lending can be attributed to bank regulations that constrain banks’ ability to lend to unprofitable and highly levered borrowers. Firms with negative EBITDA and debt/EBITDA greater than six are 32\${\textbackslash}\%\$ and 15\${\textbackslash}\%\$ more likely to borrow from nonbanks. These firms pay significantly higher interest rates, especially following the 2013 leveraged loan guidance revisions. Nonbank borrowers also receive different nonprice terms compared to firms borrowing from banks.

            We document that finance companies and FinTech lenders increased lending to small businesses after the 2008 financial crisis. We show that most of the increase substituted for a reduction in bank lending. In counties in which banks had a larger market share before the crisis, finance companies and FinTech lenders increased their lending more. We find no effect of reduced bank lending on employment, wages, and new business creation by 2016. Our results suggest that finance companies and FinTech lenders are major suppliers of credit to small businesses and played an important role in the recovery from the 2008 financial crisis.

	abstract = {We examine how a fixed capital supply shortage affects firm investment. Using equipment transaction–level data, we find pandemic-driven production disruptions significantly altered capital reallocation patterns across firms. A surge in used capital trading activity softened the investment decline, as firms acquired used capital from distant and dissimilar counterparts. Younger firms were disproportionately affected even though they rarely purchase new capital: while in normal times older firms sell their capital to younger firms, following a supply shortage, older firms compete for used capital, pricing out younger firms. Our evidence highlights the crucial role of secondary markets and distributive externalities for corporate investment.},

Using a novel database for direct lender-held loans to PE buyouts, I find that nearly all senior loans originated by direct lenders include financial covenants. Upon covenant violation, direct lenders frequently impose additional restrictions on firms’ activities during renegotiation, resulting in more conservative investment and financial policies. During the COVID-19 pandemic, direct lenders exhibited greater flexibility than banks in resolving distress through out-of-court renegotiation, in part facilitated by more equity injection from the firms’ PE sponsors. Furthermore, direct lenders’ prior relationships with PE sponsors were associated with more favorable continuation lending during the pandemic. Overall, similar to banks, direct lenders appear to actively monitor and engage in relationship lending.},

Using dual-filters of interest coverage ratio and an empirically validated default prediction model, we propose a new measure to gauge the extent of zombieism in the world’s 20 largest economies. The average zombie share of listed firms has increased significantly since 1990, to about 7\% in 2020. Zombie firms are typically found among small and medium-sized enterprises. Economic growth, industry compositions, and lenient monetary policies have strong explanatory power for global zombieism. We show that the presence of zombie firms generates significant market congestion, limiting the growth of healthy firms. We also find that the development of global corporate bond markets contributes to zombie firm growth. Leveraging staggered bankruptcy reforms as an exogenous variation, we find that these reforms lower zombie ratio by 1.4\% points. The reduction is more substantial if the bankruptcy law becomes more creditor-friendly. Having failed to recover, zombie firms can survive for an average of 5 years before declaring bankruptcy, being delisted, or being acquired. Bankruptcy reforms accelerate the dissolution of zombie status.},

Responding to this concern, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-13, which requires large public (small public and private) banks to accrue for loan losses using the current expected credit loss (CECL) approach starting in 2020 (2023). Contrary to this concern, we hypothesize and find that banks that adopted CECL prior to the COVID-19 pandemic reduced loan growth during the accompanying recession more than other banks. We further predict and find that this effect is stronger (weaker) for adopting banks with low regulatory capital (with low heterogenous loans or that recorded large increases in credit loss allowances upon their initial adoption of CECL). We also find that adopting banks increased their loan loss provisions during the recession more than other banks.

Likely as a result, zombie ﬁrms exit the market through bankruptcy at a faster rate than other ﬁrms. To sharpen the causal interpretation of our ﬁndings, we exploit the sudden and sizeable drop in global oil prices in 2014–2015 as a natural experiment to identify levered ﬁrms that transition into zombie status and banks that suffer loan losses on their balance sheets. In contrast to existing ﬁndings for other countries, our evidence suggests that in the United States bank lending is not a key driver of zombie ﬁrms’ proliferation and survival.},

	abstract = {A more timely recognition of credit losses, combined with envisaged improvements to banks’ credit risk management, is expected to make a significant contribution to financial stability. In practice, nonetheless, this assumption largely depends on the extent to which models can anticipate downturns and the borrowers which will be more severely affected by them (in line with the findings of Grünberger, 2012), which in turn generates modelling risk. In this regard, back-testing of models, even if not explicitly required by the standards, can be a powerful way of assessing and improving their predictive power. Furthermore, in the case of the ECL approach, the application of the concept of a “significant increase in credit risk” is important to ensure that the financial stability benefits of the expected credit loss approach are effectively reaped. Given a range of possible definitions for a “significant increase in credit risk”, higher (i.e. less conservative) thresholds would lead to lower impairment charges in normal times and, as a result, higher charges in anticipation of downturns. Consequently, excessively high thresholds could hamper the early recognition of credit losses (which is something that IFRS 9 attempts to achieve). In contrast, lower (i.e. more conservative) thresholds could result in double-counting of expected credit losses that are already reflected in the fair value of the loan at the time of its inception, with possible side effects on the availability of credit and banks’ profitability. It is therefore important that banks use appropriate criteria in determining that threshold in order to ensure a timely determination as to whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk following the initial recognition of a loan and, more generally, ensure that banks are able to properly adjust to the existing macroeconomic conditions at any time, strengthening financial stability.},

            Launched in Summer 2012, the European Central Bank’s (ECB) Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT) program indirectly recapitalized European banks through its positive impact on periphery sovereign bonds. However, the stability reestablished in the banking sector did not fully translate into economic growth. We document zombie lending by banks that remained weakly capitalized even post-OMT. In turn, firms receiving loans used these funds not to undertake real economic activity, such as employment and investment, but to build cash reserves. Creditworthy firms in industries with a high zombie firm prevalence significantly suffered from this credit misallocation, which further slowed the economic recovery.

Looking over multiple cycles, nonbanks' credit supply is roughly three times more cyclical than banks', suggesting that nonbanks are the main drivers of syndicated lending cycles. A model in which government support stabilizes bank funding can explain the higher cyclicality of nonbanks.},

The firm’s financing capacity is endogenously determined by either the liquidation value of assets (asset-based) or the intermediary’s going-concern valuation of the firm’s cash flows (cash flow-based). We implement the optimal contract between the firm and intermediary with both unsecured and secured debt (credit lines) in an overlapping pecking order: the firm simultaneously finances cash flow shortfalls with unsecured debt and either cash reserves (if available) or secured debt (otherwise). Improved access to equity financing increases debt capacity, thus debt and equity are dynamic complements. When the firm does well, it repays its debt in full, while when in distress, repayment dynamics mirror U.S. bankruptcy procedures.},

Our registered report proposal seeks to address this gap by surveying and interviewing Chief Financial Officers (CFOs) at U.S. private firms about their internal information production and reporting choices. We organize our survey into four topics. Topic \#1 explores the characteristics of financial information used within the firm—the types of reports prepared, the level of performance measurement, and the internal and external parties that can access this information. The second and third topics examine firms producing GAAP financial statements. Topic \#2 asks about assurance choices, preparers, and the cost-effectiveness of specific standards. Topic \#3 examines how much influence various parties (e.g., banks, suppliers, equity investors, senior managers) exert on the firm’s decision to prepare GAAP financial statements, as well as the costs and benefits of providing statements to these parties. Our final topic studies firms that do not prepare GAAP financial statements, and explores this choice. All topics permit us to study cross-sectional variation related to ownership, financing choices, firm size, and accounting practice. We expect our study to advance research on management accounting, reporting, and auditing.},

Second, banks are increasingly competing with nonbank lenders that rely less on AFS in screening and monitoring.

U.S. banks transferred \$.9 trillion to their HTM portfolios by relabeling securities as HTM. Accounting rules determine that banks must have not only the intent but also the ability to hold securities to maturity when using HTM accounting.

We show that violations are followed immediately by a decline in acquisitions and capital expenditures, a sharp reduction in leverage and shareholder payouts, and an increase in CEO turnover. The changes in the investment and financing behavior of violating firms coincide with amended credit agreements that contain stronger restrictions on firm decision-making; changes in the management of violating firms suggest that creditors also exert informal influence on corporate governance. Finally, we show that firm operating and stock price performance improve post-violation. We conclude that actions taken by creditors increase the value of the average violating firm.},

The effect is weaker when rivals have more expertise in the local market, are less concerned about credit risk due to mortgage sales, and locate in areas with more alternative information about the CFPB banks. The effect is concentrated in severe complaints and complaints related to loan underwriting practices. In addition to approving more loans, rivals also open more branches and are more likely to post a job opening in these markets.

            We adapt simple tools from computational linguistics to construct a new measure of political risk faced by individual U.S. firms: the share of their quarterly earnings conference calls that they devote to political risks. We validate our measure by showing that it correctly identifies calls containing extensive conversations on risks that are political in nature, that it varies intuitively over time and across sectors, and that it correlates with the firm’s actions and stock market volatility in a manner that is highly indicative of political risk. Firms exposed to political risk retrench hiring and investment and actively lobby and donate to politicians. These results continue to hold after controlling for news about the mean (as opposed to the variance) of political shocks. Interestingly, the vast majority of the variation in our measure is at the firm level rather than at the aggregate or sector level, in the sense that it is captured neither by the interaction of sector and time fixed effects nor by heterogeneous exposure of individual firms to aggregate political risk. The dispersion of this firm-level political risk increases significantly at times with high aggregate political risk. Decomposing our measure of political risk by topic, we find that firms that devote more time to discussing risks associated with a given political topic tend to increase lobbying on that topic, but not on other topics, in the following quarter.},

We explore heterogeneity in industry standards and find more pronounced effects for (i) industry standards that reveal new information, provide explicit guidance, or in­ crease accounting uniformity, and (ii) small firms, firms with greater information asymmetry, and firms with greater capital constraints before implementation of the standards.

This main result, when combined with our cross-sectional analyses, offers evidence suggesting that deregulation leads to less demand for higher quality auditors because (1) firms have increased access to credit, which reduces the benefits of higher audit quality; (2) entering banks’ lending expertise substitutes for higher quality financial statements; (3) incumbent banks with less lending expertise seek to protect their rents by preferring that borrowers provide lower quality financial statement information; and (4) external stakeholders delegate their monitoring to banks to a greater degree, resulting in less demand for higher quality financial statements.

            We quantify the real implications of trade-offs between firm information disclosure and long-term investment efficiency. We estimate a dynamic equilibrium model in which firm managers confront realistic incentives to misreport earnings and distort their real investment choices. The model implies a socially optimal level of disclosure regulation that exceeds the estimated value. Counterfactual analysis reveals that eliminating earnings misreporting completely through disclosure regulation incentivizes managers to distort real investment. Lower earnings informativeness raises the cost of capital, which results in a 5.7\${\textbackslash}\%\$ drop in average firm value, but more modest effects on social welfare and aggregate growth.

We show how optimal covenants vary with the degree of conservatism and derive an efficiency metric that depends on the degree of conservatism.

Restaurant characteristics explain an additional 9.8 percentage points of the gap in PPP borrowing. The remaining 9.2 percentage points disparity is driven by a 16.8 percentage points disparity in PPP borrowing from banks, which is partially offset by greater borrowing from nonbanks, largely fintechs. Disparities in PPP borrowing cannot be attributed to lower awareness of PPP loans or lower demand for PPP loans by minority-owned restaurants. We use a broader sample of firms that were likely eligible for PPP loans to show that our findings apply more broadly across industries and are not limited to Florida. In counties with more racial bias, Black-owned firms are significantly less likely to receive bank PPP loans and to substitute to nonbank PPP loans. This substitution, however, is not strong enough to eliminate racial disparities in PPP borrowing.},

            Macro-finance analyses commonly link firms’ borrowing constraints to the liquidation value of physical assets. For U.S. nonfinancial firms, we show that 20\% of debt by value is based on such assets (asset-based lending in creditor parlance), whereas 80\% is based predominantly on cash flows from firms’ operations (cash flow–based lending). A standard borrowing constraint restricts total debt as a function of cash flows measured using operating earnings (earnings-based borrowing constraints). These features shape firm outcomes on the margin: first, cash flows in the form of operating earnings can directly relax borrowing constraints; second, firms are less vulnerable to collateral damage from asset price declines, and fire sale amplification may be mitigated. Taken together, our findings point to new venues for modeling firms’ borrowing constraints in macro-finance studies.},

Using two distinct measures of lender-specific shocks—defaults in a lender’s corporate loan portfolio that occur outside the borrower’s region and industry, and noncorporate loan delinquencies—we show that lenders respond to financial shocks by increasing the number and strictness of performance-based but not of capital-based covenants in debt contracts. We examine two possible channels for this result. We find evidence consistent with lenders using stricter control rights because of concerns about capital depletion (a capital channel) and because of new information about lenders’ own screening ability (a learning channel). Our results indicate that lender preferences influence how accounting information is used in debt contracts.},

	abstract = {This paper explores restrictions in private lending agreements to determtne how contractors" status affects (I) the number of limitations on managerial actions and (2) tighttiess (or slack) of contract restrictions at contract inception. The major result of the multivariate tests is that highly leveraged borrowers are forced to negotiate agreements with both more numerous and tighter restrictions. Debt contracts represent a series of rational trade-offs. Firms with higher debt face more restrictions, which are tighter and more likely to restnct managerial actions. Similarly, borrowers are more likely to agree to tighter extensive restrictions in exchange for more substantial loans. The evidence also indicates that larger firms that possess greater resources to avoid default are able to negotiate looser agreements that contain fewer restrictions. Secured loans do not impose a large number of accounting-based restrictions on managements" actions because secured lenders have less need to restrict managements" options. However, longterm agreements, including insurance loans, include more restrictions on dividends and payout options but use covenant ratios to allow managemeni the flexibility needed over the course of a long-term loan.},

We quantify social media’s role in this distress using comprehensive Twitter data. During the SVB run period, banks in the top tercile of pre-run Twitter exposure lost 6.6 percentage points more stock market value, an effect unexplained by mark-to-market losses and uninsured deposits. Moreover, social media amplifies balance sheet risks and is associated with greater outflow of uninsured deposits during Q1 2023. During the run period, high Twitter message volume in the past four hours predicts hourly stock market losses, especially for banks with high balance sheet risk. At even higher frequency, negative sentiment tweets in the run period translate into immediate stock market losses. These high frequency effects are stronger for tweets with contagion keywords and tweets by tech startup users who are likely depositors in SVB.},

	abstract = {The United States has been experiencing a slowdown in measured labor productivity growth since 2004. A number of commentators and researchers have suggested that this slowdown is at least in part illusory because real output data have failed to capture the new and better products of the past decade. I conduct four disparate analyses, each of which offers empirical challenges to this “mismeasurement hypothesis.” First, the productivity slowdown has occurred in dozens of countries, and its size is unrelated to measures of the countries' consumption or production intensities of information and communication technologies (ICTs, the type of goods most often cited as sources of mismeasurement). Second, estimates from the existing research literature of the surplus created by internet-linked digital technologies fall far short of the \$3 trillion or more of “missing output” resulting from the productivity growth slowdown. Third, if measurement problems were to account for even a modest share of this missing output, the properly measured output and productivity growth rates of industries that produce and service ICTs would have to have been multiples of their measured growth in the data. Fourth, while measured gross domestic income has been on average higher than measured gross domestic product since 2004—perhaps indicating workers are being paid to make products that are given away for free or at highly discounted prices—this trend actually began before the productivity slowdown and moreover reflects unusually high capital income rather than labor income (i.e., profits are unusually high). In combination, these complementary facets of evidence suggest that the reasonable prima facie case for the mismeasurement hypothesis faces real hurdles when confronted with the data.},

            This paper finds that banks and nonbanks respond differently to increased competition in consumer credit markets. Increased competition and a greater threat of failure induces banks to specialize in relationship business lending, and surviving banks are more profitable. However, nonbanks change their credit policy when faced with more competition and expand credit to riskier borrowers at the extensive margin, resulting in higher default rates. These results show how the effects of competition depend on the form of intermediation. They also suggest that increased competition can cause credit risk to migrate outside the traditional supervisory umbrella.},

Did the inflow of institutional funding in the syndicated loan market lead to mispricing of credit? To understand this relation, we look at the institutional demand pressure defined as the number of days a loan remains in syndication. Using market-level and cross-sectional variation in time-on-the-market, we find that a shorter syndication period is associated with a lower final interest rate. The relation is robust to the use of institutional fund flow as an instrument. Furthermore, we find significant price differences between institutional investors’ tranches and banks’ tranches of the same loans, even though they share the same underlying fundamentals. Increasing demand pressure causes the interest rate on institutional tranches to fall below the interest rate on bank tranches. Overall, a one-standard-deviation reduction in average time-on-the-market decreases the interest rate for institutional loans by over 30 basis points per annum. While this effect is significantly larger for loan tranches bought by collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), it is not fully explained by their role.},

This argument follows from the critique he presented of existing models of capital structure and from the theory he outlined of the optimal aggregate capital structure of the economy as a whole. That theory depends on the existence of different marginal tax rates for individuals and a tax-free security. Professor Miller pointed out that he was motivated to develop his hypothesis by the apparent inadequacy of a (if not the most) popular explanation for capital structure at both the micro and the aggregate level: the tradeoff between the tax advantages of debt and the cost to the firm's security holders of the bankruptcy process. He observed that neither the tax advantage of debt nor the costs of bankruptcy may be quite what they seem at first glance. When the corporate income tax and the differential taxation of regular income and capital gains are taken into account, then the tax advantage of debt is reduced. Moreover, the limited empirical evidence from actual bankruptcies suggests that the real costs to security holders of bankruptcy may be really rather low. And the recent discussion by Haugen and Senbet [6] suggests that most of the costs attributed to bankruptcy are really costs of liquidation of the firm's assets and not relevant to the capital structure decision.},

@article{buchak_secular_2024,
	title = {The {Secular} {Decline} of {Bank} {Balance} {Sheet} {Lending}},
	abstract = {The traditional model of bank-led financial intermediation, where banks issue demandable deposits to savers and make informationally sensitive loans to borrowers, has seen a dramatic decline since 1970s. Instead, private credit is increasingly intermediated through arms-length transactions, such as securitization. This paper documents these trends, explores their causes, and discusses their implications for the financial system and regulation. We document that the balance sheet share of overall private lending has declined from 60\% in 1970 to 35\% in 2023, while the deposit share of savings has declined from 22\% to 13\%. Additionally, the share of loans as a percentage of bank assets has fallen from 70\% to 55\%. We develop a structural model to explore whether technological improvements in securitization, shifts in saver preferences away from deposits, and changes in implicit subsidies and costs of bank activities can explain these shifts. Declines in securitization cost account for changes in aggregate lending quantities. Savers, rather than borrowers, are the main drivers of bank balance sheet size. Implicit banks’ costs and subsidies explain shifting bank balance sheet composition. Together, these forces explain the fall in the overall share of informationally sensitive bank lending in credit intermediation. We conclude by examining how these shifts impact the financial sector’s sensitivity to macroprudential regulation. While raising capital requirements or liquidity requirements decreases lending in both early (1960s) and recent (2020’s) scenarios, the effect is less pronounced in the later period due to the reduced role of bank balance sheets in credit intermediation. The substitution of bank balance sheet loans with debt securities in response to these policies explains why we observe only a fairly modest decline in aggregate lending despite a large contraction of bank balance sheet lending. Overall, we find that the intermediation sector has undergone significant transformation, with implications for macroprudential policy and financial regulation.},

We address these questions in a model in which a lender originates loans that it can sell to investors.

The optimal lender-investor contract can be implemented by requiring the lender to initially retain a share of the loan that it gradually sells to investors, rationalizing loan sales after origination. The model generates novel predictions linking loan and lender characteristics to initial retention, sales dynamics, and loan performance.},

Covenants are expected to constrain managerial opportunism, however, only if the accounting system recognizes economic losses in earnings in a timely fashion. Thus, the demand for timely loss recognition should increase with a contract’s reliance on covenants. Consistent with this conjecture, I ﬁnd evidence that reliance on covenants in public debt contracts is positively associated with the degree of timely loss recognition. I also ﬁnd evidence that the presence of prior private debt mitigates this relationship.},

In the aftermath of the financial crisis, direct lending has been the most rapidly growing credit market segment. I document that direct lending activity increases when commercial banks face greater regulatory pressure and during periods of weak bank loan and securitized debt issuance. Direct lenders are particularly active in geographic regions that experience more bank mergers and primarily focus on informationally opaque borrowers with limited credit history and few financing alternatives. Moreover, direct loans have higher interest rate, more flexible covenant structures and are more likely to be secured by borrower’s capital stock compared to institutional loans issued by banks. I further show that direct loans experience similar or somewhat better post-issuance performance compared to bank-originated institutional loans. Overall, I provide evidence consistent with the view that direct lending expanded the credit space without giving rise to adverse selection costs.},

We find that business development companies (BDCs) — closed-end funds that provide a significant share of nonbank loans to middle market firms — are very well capitalized according to bank capital frameworks. They have average capital ratios of about 33\% and excess capital in severely stressed scenarios. Thus, private credit has not grown because nonbank financial intermediaries have to hold less capital than banks. Instead, we argue that banks find lending to BDCs to facilitate their middle market lending more attractive than making loans to middle market lending. This is, in part, because over-collateralized loans to BDCs and other nonbank financial intermediaries get relatively favorable capital treatment, enabling banks to exploit their low-cost funding. It is also attractive because the loans are relatively large and thus less costly to originate, underwrite, and service than a portfolio of middle market loans.},

            We investigate the connections between bank capital regulation and the prevalence of lightly regulated nonbanks (shadow banks) in the U.S. corporate loan market. For identification, we exploit a supervisory credit register of syndicated loans, loan-time fixed effects, and shocks to capital requirements arising from surprise features of the U.S. implementation of Basel III. We find that less-capitalized banks reduce loan retention, particularly among loans with higher capital requirements and at times when capital is scarce, and nonbanks step in. This reallocation is associated with important adverse effects during the 2008 crisis: loans funded by nonbanks with fragile liabilities are less likely to be rolled over and experience greater price volatility.},

Prior theory and evidence suggest that renegotiation considerations from coordination difficulties in large syndicates and intertemporal transfers due to relationship lending in small syndicates are factors in the design of covenants. I find that for large syndicates, borrowers and lenders avoid the use of flexibility-reducing covenants that are more likely to impact negatively on value-enhancing corporate policies (e.g., investments) in good states of the world. This effect becomes stronger when the borrower has fewer outside financing options. Additionally, I find that contracts with large syndicates are more likely to have more covenant slack, include performance pricing provisions, have tailored capital expenditure covenants that alleviate over- and underinvestment problems, and principally rely on covenants that are directly linked to the current performance of the borrower. Collectively, these results imply that syndicate size and related renegotiation considerations affect how accounting information is used in debt contracts.},

Renegotiations result in large changes to the amount, maturity, and pricing of the contract, occur relatively early in the life of the contract, and are rarely a consequence of distress or default. The accrual of new information concerning the credit quality, investment opportunities, and collateral of the borrower, as well as macroeconomic ﬂuctuations in credit and equity market conditions, are the primary determinants of renegotiation and its outcomes. The terms of the initial contract (e.g., contingencies) also play an important role in renegotiations; by altering the structure of the contract in a state contingent manner, renegotiation is partially controlled by the contractual assignment of bargaining power.},

We show that formal investor control is (i) increasing in the information asymmetries ex ante, (ii) increasing in the uncertainty surrounding the venture ex post, (iii) decreasing in the entrepreneur’s resources, and (iv) increasing in the entrepreneur’s incentive conf lict. In contrast, real investor control—that is, actual investor interference—is decreasing in information asymmetries. Control rights are further such that control shifts to the investor in bad states of nature.},

We ﬁnd that ﬁxed income calls are more likely to be held by ﬁrms that have more debt, lack credit ratings or have publicly traded equity, are foreign, or are experiencing losses. In a content analysis using a sample of public ﬁrms, we ﬁnd that these calls discuss debt-equity conﬂict events, such as share repurchases, to a greater degree relative to a matched sample of earnings conference calls. Finally, we document that credit markets react to these calls, consistent with the calls providing investors new information. Overall, these results are consistent with ﬁxed income calls meeting the differential informational demands of debt versus equity investors. © 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

We document that the sectoral composition of lenders financing a credit expansion is a key determinant for subsequent real activity and crisis probability. We show that banks and nonbanks respond differentially to changes in macroeconomic conditions, with bank credit more sensitive to economic downturns. Our results thus suggest that secular changes in the structure of the financial sector will affect the dynamics of credit boom-bust cycles.},

We summarize and test the implications for what we refer to as the Agency Theory of Covenants (ATC), using a large sample of privately placed corporate debt. Our results are consistent with many of the implications of the ATC, including a negative relation between the promised yield on corporate debt and the presence of covenants. We also find that borrower and lender characteristics, as well as macroeconomic factors, determine covenant structure. Loans are more likely to include protective covenants when the borrower is small, has high growth opportunities or is highly levered. Loans made by investment banks and syndicated loans are also more likely to include protective covenants, as are loans made during recessionary periods or when credit spreads are large. Finally, we show that consistent with the ATC, firms that elect to issue private rather than public debt are smaller, have greater growth opportunities, less long-term debt, fewer tangible assets, more volatile cash flows and include more covenants in their debt agreements. An important byproduct of our analysis is to demonstrate empirically that covenant structure and the yield on corporate debt are determined simultaneously.},

We ﬁnd that these effects are more pronounced for riskier ﬁrms where shareholder-debtholder conﬂicts are more severe. Moreover, ﬁrms with passed shareholder-sponsored proposals become more volatile, reﬂecting an increase in their risk-shifting incentives.

We prove that ﬁrst step estimation of the propensity score affects the large sample distribution of propensity score matching estimators, and derive adjustments to the large sample variances of propensity score matching estimators of the average treatment effect (ATE) and the average treatment effect on the treated (ATET). The adjustment for the ATE estimator is negative (or zero in some special cases), implying that matching on the estimated propensity score is more efﬁcient than matching on the true propensity score in large samples. However, for the ATET estimator, the sign of the adjustment term depends on the data generating process, and ignoring the estimation error in the propensity score may lead to conﬁdence intervals that are either too large or too small.},

Did the inﬂow of institutional funding in the syndicated loan market lead to mispricing of credit? To understand this relation, we look at the institutional demand pressure deﬁned as the number of days a loan remains in syndication. Using market-level and cross-sectional variation in time-on-the-market, we ﬁnd that a shorter syndication period is associated with a lower ﬁnal interest rate. The relation is robust to the use of institutional fund ﬂow as an instrument. Furthermore, we ﬁnd signiﬁcant price differences between institutional investors’ tranches and banks’ tranches of the same loans, even though they share the same underlying fundamentals. Increasing demand pressure causes the interest rate on institutional tranches to fall below the interest rate on bank tranches. Overall, a one-standard-deviation reduction in average time-on-the-market decreases the interest rate for institutional loans by over 30 basis points per annum. While this effect is signiﬁcantly larger for loan tranches bought by collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), it is not fully explained by their role.},

            What is the economic role played by arrangers of leveraged loans, and what are the risks they face? We provide evidence that arrangers solve a demand discovery problem. Investors have incentives to feign little interest in the loan to obtain better terms. To deter such behavior, arrangers underprice hot deals and ration investors on cold deals. The risk associated with demand discovery is often shared between borrowers and arrangers. One implication is that to ration investors on cold deals, arrangers retain larger loan shares. This motive for retention is different from the monitoring incentive motive previously considered in the literature.},

This finding is consistent with the argument that a policy of timely and detailed disclosures reduces lenders' and underwriters' perception of default risk for the disclosing firm, reducing its cost of debt. The results also indicate that the relative importance of disclosures is greater in situations where there is greater market uncertainty about the firm as reflected by the variance of stock returns. Since debt financing is an important source of external financing for publicly traded firms, the results have important implications on our understanding of the motives and consequences of corporate disclosures.},

	abstract = {In the regression-discontinuity (RD) design, units are assigned to treatment based on whether their value of an observed covariate exceeds a known cutoff. In this design, local polynomial estimators are now routinely employed to construct conﬁdence intervals for treatment effects. The performance of these conﬁdence intervals in applications, however, may be seriously hampered by their sensitivity to the speciﬁc bandwidth employed. Available bandwidth selectors typically yield a “large” bandwidth, leading to data-driven conﬁdence intervals that may be biased, with empirical coverage well below their nominal target. We propose new theory-based, more robust conﬁdence interval estimators for average treatment effects at the cutoff in sharp RD, sharp kink RD, fuzzy RD, and fuzzy kink RD designs. Our proposed conﬁdence intervals are constructed using a bias-corrected RD estimator together with a novel standard error estimator. For practical implementation, we discuss mean squared error optimal bandwidths, which are by construction not valid for conventional conﬁdence intervals but are valid with our robust approach, and consistent standard error estimators based on our new variance formulas. In a special case of practical interest, our procedure amounts to running a quadratic instead of a linear local regression. More generally, our results give a formal justiﬁcation to simple inference procedures based on increasing the order of the local polynomial estimator employed. We ﬁnd in a simulation study that our conﬁdence intervals exhibit close-to-correct empirical coverage and good empirical interval length on average, remarkably improving upon the alternatives available in the literature.

	abstract = {Nonparametric methods play a central role in modern empirical work. While they provide inference procedures that are more robust to parametric misspecification bias, they may be quite sensitive to tuning parameter choices. We study the effects of bias correction on confidence interval coverage in the context of kernel density and local polynomial regression estimation, and prove that bias correction can be preferred to undersmoothing for minimizing coverage error and increasing robustness to tuning parameter choice. This is achieved using a novel, yet simple, Studentization, which leads to a new way of constructing kernel-based bias-corrected confidence intervals. In addition, for practical cases, we derive coverage error optimal bandwidths and discuss easy-to-implement bandwidth selectors. For interior points, we show that the mean-squared error (MSE)-optimal bandwidth for the original point estimator (before bias correction) delivers the fastest coverage error decay rate after bias correction when second-order (equivalent) kernels are employed, but is otherwise suboptimal because it is too “large.” Finally, for odd-degree local polynomial regression, we show that, as with point estimation, coverage error adapts to boundary points automatically when appropriate Studentization is used; however, the MSE-optimal bandwidth for the original point estimator is suboptimal. All the results are established using valid Edgeworth expansions and illustrated with simulated data. Our findings have important consequences for empirical work as they indicate that biascorrected confidence intervals, coupled with appropriate standard errors, have smaller coverage error and are less sensitive to tuning parameter choices in practically relevant cases where additional smoothness is available.

Furthermore, while public-side lending increases within-syndicate information asymmetry, our ﬁndings indicate that it does not materially increase interest spreads and is associated with lower coordination costs among syndicate participants.
