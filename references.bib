	abstract = {We study the role of borrower accounting quality in debt contracting. Specifically, we examine how accounting quality affects the borrower's choice of private versus public debt market and how the design of debt contracts vary with accounting quality in the two markets. We find that accounting quality affects the choice of the market, with poorer accounting quality borrowers preferring private debt, i.e., bank loans. This is consistent with banks possessing superior information access and processing abilities that reduce adverse selection costs for borrowers. We also find that accounting quality has an economically significant but differential impact on contract design in the two markets consistent with differences in recontracting flexibility across the two markets. In the case of private debt, since there is greater recontracting flexibility, both the price (i.e., interest) and non-price (i.e., maturity and collateral) terms are significantly more stringent for poorer accounting quality borrowers, unlike public debt where only the price terms are more stringent. The impact of accounting quality on interest spreads of public debt is 2.5 times that of the private debt, since the price terms alone reflect the variation in accounting quality.},

	abstract = {Building on contract theory, we argue that ﬁnancial covenants control the conﬂicts of interest between lenders and borrowers via two different mechanisms. Capital covenants control agency problems by aligning debt holder–shareholder interests. Performance covenants serve as trip wires that limit agency problems via the transfer of control to lenders in states where the value of their claim is at risk. Companies trade off these mechanisms. Capital covenants impose costly restrictions on the capital structure, while performance covenants require contractible accounting information to be available. Consistent with these arguments, we ﬁnd that the use of performance covenants relative to capital covenants is positively associated with (1) the ﬁnancial constraints of the borrower, (2) the extent to which accounting information portrays credit risk, (3) the likelihood of contract renegotiation, and (4) the presence of contractual restrictions on managerial actions. Our ﬁndings suggest that accounting-based covenants can improve contracting efﬁciency in two different ways.},

Further, we document that the inﬂuence of DCV on the proportion of the loan retained is conditional on the lead arranger’s reputation, the existence of a credit rating, and the lead arranger’s previous relationships with the same borrower. Finally, we ﬁnd that when loans include performance pricing provisions, the likelihood that the single performance measure used is an accounting ratio, rather than a credit rating, is increasing in DCV.},

Seven academic proxies are significantly associated with only one audit process quality measure, and five have insignificant associations with both practitioner assessments. Overall, the significant associations indicate that practitioners and academics share common ground in identifying low-quality audits.

            Using Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) inspection data from 2006 to 2018, we examine the use of auditor‐employed specialists in audit engagements. First, we find that the use of specialists is increasingly prevalent and related to clients’ size and complex accounting estimates. Second, the use of specialists is positively associated with the incidence of audit process deficiencies (identified by PCAOB inspections) but is not associated with output‐based audit‐quality proxies (restatements or absolute discretionary accruals). Hence, although process deficiencies are more likely to occur in engagements with higher use of specialists, financial reporting quality is not negatively impacted. Third, the use of specialists is positively associated with the likelihood of goodwill impairments and negatively associated with engagement profitability. Finally, cross‐sectional tests suggest that board accounting expertise is a salient condition for more effective use of specialists. Collectively, our findings align with concerns noted by the PCAOB and prior experimental and survey studies. Although specialists assist auditors with the audit of complex estimates, engagements with comparatively high specialist use entail an incremental risk of audit process deficiencies.},

Due to highly nonlinear ampliﬁcation effects, the economy is prone to instability and occasionally enters volatile crisis episodes. Endogenous risk, driven by asset illiquidity, persists in crisis even for very low levels of exogenous risk. This phenomenon, which we call the volatility paradox, resolves the Kocherlakota ( 2000) critique. Endogenous leverage determines the distance to crisis. Securitization and derivatives contracts that improve risk sharing may lead to higher leverage and more frequent crises. (JEL E13, E32, E44, E52, G01, G12, G20)},

Banks with more uninsured deposits experienced greater equity value declines and stock price risk after the start of 2022 when interest rates rose sharply. Before 2022, these banks also had greater stock price risk, profitability, valuations, executive pay, and exposure to commercial loans than other banks but had similar exposure to securities. To explain these facts, we develop a model where banks better at risk-taking attract large uninsured depositors who have loan demand. Rising interest rates and decreased loan demand reduce lending relationship values, leading to outflows from riskier banks.},

	abstract = {One of the key questions in the study of regulation is whether the costs of regulatory compliance fall homogeneously on all businesses or whether certain firms, for instance small ones, are especially penalized. We quantify firms’ compliance costs in terms of their labor spending to adhere to government rules. Using comprehensive establishment-level occupational microdata and occupation-specific task information, we recover the proportion of a firm’s wage bill attributable to employees engaged in regulatory compliance. On average for 2002-14, regulatory costs account for 1.34\% to 3.33\% of a firm’s wage bill, totaling up in 2014 to \$239 billion, and to \$289 billion when adding capital equipment costs. Our findings reveal an inverted-U relation between firms’ regulatory compliance costs and their scale of employment, indicating that firms with approximately 500 employees face compliance costs that are about 40 percent higher as a share of total wages compared to small or large firms. Finally, we develop an instrumental variable methodology to disentangle the influence of regulatory requirements and enforcement in driving firms’ compliance costs.},

I ﬁnd that, in response to a contraction in bank credit supply, aggregate bond issuance in the corporate sector increases, but not enough to avoid a decline in aggregate borrowing and investment. Keeping leverage constant while retiring bank debt would expose ﬁrms to a higher risk of ﬁnancial distress; they offset this by reducing total borrowing. A calibration of the model to the Great Recession indicates that this precautionary mechanism can account for one-third of the total decline in investment by ﬁrms with access to bond markets.},

Within manufacturing, we show that industry leaders invest and innovate more in response to exogenous changes in Chinese competition. Beyond manufacturing we show that excess entry in the late 1990's, which is orthogonal to demand shocks in the 2000's, predicts higher industry investment given Q.

            We examine historical banking crises through the lens of bank equity declines, which cover a broad sample of episodes of banking distress with and without banking panics. To do this, we construct a new data set on bank equity returns and narrative information on banking panics for 46 countries over the period of 1870 to 2016. We find that even in the absence of panics, large bank equity declines are associated with substantial credit contractions and output gaps. Although panics are an important amplification mechanism, our results indicate that panics are not necessary for banking crises to have severe economic consequences. Furthermore, panics tend to be preceded by large bank equity declines, suggesting that panics are the result, rather than the cause, of earlier bank losses. We use bank equity returns to uncover a number of forgotten historical banking crises and create a banking crisis chronology that distinguishes between bank equity losses and panics.},

	abstract = {Existing macroeconomic models focused on bank balance sheet lending are deficient because they do not account for the modern industrial organization of financial intermediation. Utilizing publicly available micro-level lending data, we investigate two increasingly significant margins of adjustment in credit markets: banks’ ability to sell loans and shadow bank activity. These adjustment margins are substantial and vary across time and regions with different incomes. We examine these margins in a parsimonious dynamic quantitative model featuring banks with balance sheet adjustment through loan sales and shadow banks. Using the calibrated model, we illustrate that these margins significantly dampen the immediate contraction following bank capital shock. Recovery is also faster, because profitable loan sales (e.g., securitization) allow banks to build capital faster and because shadow banks pick up lending slack. Failure to account for adjustment margins leads to significant errors when studying policies which rely on financial intermediation pass-through in the level of aggregate lending, its direction, and composition. Our model highlights the tension between bank balance sheet models and data. The model, which forces total lending to depend strongly on bank balance sheet health, must reconcile the weak correlation between bank capital and aggregate lending. These issues can be reconciled with now available data from bank balance sheets, overall bank lending, and aggregate lending, in conjunction with a model of modern financial intermediation.},

            Despite its large and increasing size in the United States and Europe, the private debt (PD) market, compared to the bank and syndicated loan markets, has been researched little. In this paper, we survey U.S. and European investors with private debt assets under management (AuM) of over \$390 billion. These investors are primarily direct lending funds. We ask the general partners (GPs) how they source, select, and evaluate deals; how they think of private debt relative to bank and syndicated loan financing; how they monitor their investments; how they interact with private equity (PE) sponsors; and how they view the future of the market. Respondents provide primarily cash-flow-based loans and believe that they finance companies and leverage levels that banks would not fund. Direct lending funds target unlevered returns that appear high relative to their risk. They use leverage in their funds, but appreciably less than banks and collateralized loan obligation funds (CLOs). They use and negotiate for both financial and negative covenants to monitor their investments. The presence of PE sponsors helps them lend more and craft more effective covenants. U.S. and European funds are similar along many dimensions, but European funds rely less on PE sponsors and compete more with banks. Overall, the private debt market is both different from and shares characteristics with bank loan and syndicated loan markets. (JEL G23, G30, G32)},

            We document that finance companies and FinTech lenders increased lending to small businesses after the 2008 financial crisis. We show that most of the increase substituted for a reduction in bank lending. In counties in which banks had a larger market share before the crisis, finance companies and FinTech lenders increased their lending more. We find no effect of reduced bank lending on employment, wages, and new business creation by 2016. Our results suggest that finance companies and FinTech lenders are major suppliers of credit to small businesses and played an important role in the recovery from the 2008 financial crisis.

Using a novel database for direct lender-held loans to PE buyouts, I find that nearly all senior loans originated by direct lenders include financial covenants. Upon covenant violation, direct lenders frequently impose additional restrictions on firms’ activities during renegotiation, resulting in more conservative investment and financial policies. During the COVID-19 pandemic, direct lenders exhibited greater flexibility than banks in resolving distress through out-of-court renegotiation, in part facilitated by more equity injection from the firms’ PE sponsors. Furthermore, direct lenders’ prior relationships with PE sponsors were associated with more favorable continuation lending during the pandemic. Overall, similar to banks, direct lenders appear to actively monitor and engage in relationship lending.},

We then provide an overview of how zombie lending can be attenuated. Finally, we use a sample of US publicly listed firms to compare various measures proposed in the literature to classify firms as “zombies.” We identify definitions of zombie firms that are adequate to investigate economic inefficiency in the form of real sector competitive distortions of zombie lending. We find that only definitions based on interest rate subsidies are able to detect these spillovers and thereby provide evidence in support of credit misallocation.},

	abstract = {Academics and practitioners are increasingly concerned about global zombieism, a term used to describe insolvent firms that survive with the support of financial institutions, investors, or governments, particularly during unusual market conditions. Using dual-filters of interest coverage ratio and an empirically validated default prediction model, we propose a new measure to gauge the extent of zombieism in the world’s 20 largest economies. The average zombie share of listed firms has increased significantly since 1990, to about 7\% in 2020. Zombie firms are typically found among small and medium-sized enterprises. Economic growth, industry compositions, and lenient monetary policies have strong explanatory power for global zombieism. We show that the presence of zombie firms generates significant market congestion, limiting the growth of healthy firms. We also find that the development of global corporate bond markets contributes to zombie firm growth. Leveraging staggered bankruptcy reforms as an exogenous variation, we find that these reforms lower zombie ratio by 1.4\% points. The reduction is more substantial if the bankruptcy law becomes more creditor-friendly. Having failed to recover, zombie firms can survive for an average of 5 years before declaring bankruptcy, being delisted, or being acquired. Bankruptcy reforms accelerate the dissolution of zombie status.},

In the wake of the financial crisis, policymakers expressed the concern that banks’ use of the incurred loss model exacerbates their lending procyclicality by delaying the recognition of loan losses to recessions when the losses become incurred, probable, and reasonably estimable. Responding to this concern, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-13, which requires large public (small public and private) banks to accrue for loan losses using the current expected credit loss (CECL) approach starting in 2020 (2023). Contrary to this concern, we hypothesize and find that banks that adopted CECL prior to the COVID-19 pandemic reduced loan growth during the accompanying recession more than other banks. We further predict and find that this effect is stronger (weaker) for adopting banks with low regulatory capital (with low heterogenous loans or that recorded large increases in credit loss allowances upon their initial adoption of CECL). We also find that adopting banks increased their loan loss provisions during the recession more than other banks. Our results are consistent with the CECL approach increasing banks’ lending procyclicality.},

Banks—including the weakly capitalized ones—reduce their exposure to ﬁrms that transition into zombie status, charge zombie ﬁrms higher loan rates, and assess these ﬁrms as having higher default probability. Likely as a result, zombie ﬁrms exit the market through bankruptcy at a faster rate than other ﬁrms. To sharpen the causal interpretation of our ﬁndings, we exploit the sudden and sizeable drop in global oil prices in 2014–2015 as a natural experiment to identify levered ﬁrms that transition into zombie status and banks that suffer loan losses on their balance sheets. In contrast to existing ﬁndings for other countries, our evidence suggests that in the United States bank lending is not a key driver of zombie ﬁrms’ proliferation and survival.},

	abstract = {We examine whether the adoption of the current expected credit losses (CECL) model, which reflects forward-looking information in loan loss provisions (LLP), improves banks’ information production. Consistent with better information production, we find changes in CECL banks’ financial reporting and operations. First, these banks’ loan loss provisions become timelier and better reflect future local economic conditions. Second, CECL banks disclose longer, more forward-looking, and more quantitative LLP information. Lastly, they have fewer loan defaults after adopting CECL. These improvements are greater for banks that invest more in CECL-related information systems and human capital and even more salient for larger banks. Our findings suggest that banks’ information production is improved under a more forward-looking accounting standard. However, these improvements are greater for banks with more resources to invest in related technology and human capital.},

	title = {Expected credit loss approaches in {Europe} and the {United} {States}: differences from a financial stability perspective},
	abstract = {A more timely recognition of credit losses, combined with envisaged improvements to banks’ credit risk management, is expected to make a significant contribution to financial stability. In practice, nonetheless, this assumption largely depends on the extent to which models can anticipate downturns and the borrowers which will be more severely affected by them (in line with the findings of Grünberger, 2012), which in turn generates modelling risk. In this regard, back-testing of models, even if not explicitly required by the standards, can be a powerful way of assessing and improving their predictive power. Furthermore, in the case of the ECL approach, the application of the concept of a “significant increase in credit risk” is important to ensure that the financial stability benefits of the expected credit loss approach are effectively reaped. Given a range of possible definitions for a “significant increase in credit risk”, higher (i.e. less conservative) thresholds would lead to lower impairment charges in normal times and, as a result, higher charges in anticipation of downturns. Consequently, excessively high thresholds could hamper the early recognition of credit losses (which is something that IFRS 9 attempts to achieve). In contrast, lower (i.e. more conservative) thresholds could result in double-counting of expected credit losses that are already reflected in the fair value of the loan at the time of its inception, with possible side effects on the availability of credit and banks’ profitability. It is therefore important that banks use appropriate criteria in determining that threshold in order to ensure a timely determination as to whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk following the initial recognition of a loan and, more generally, ensure that banks are able to properly adjust to the existing macroeconomic conditions at any time, strengthening financial stability.},

            Launched in Summer 2012, the European Central Bank’s (ECB) Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT) program indirectly recapitalized European banks through its positive impact on periphery sovereign bonds. However, the stability reestablished in the banking sector did not fully translate into economic growth. We document zombie lending by banks that remained weakly capitalized even post-OMT. In turn, firms receiving loans used these funds not to undertake real economic activity, such as employment and investment, but to build cash reserves. Creditworthy firms in industries with a high zombie firm prevalence significantly suffered from this credit misallocation, which further slowed the economic recovery.

Unlike comparable non PE-backed firms that primarily use asset-based debt, PE-backed firms rely extensively on cash flow-based debt subject to earnings-based borrowing constraints, and their borrowing and investment exhibit high sensitivity to earnings. Enhancing access to and utilization of cash flow-based borrowing, private equity raises both the level and cash flow sensitivity of leverage. Documenting that PE sponsors inject equity and stabilize earnings in distress, we highlight PE sponsors' involvement in distress resolution as a key mechanism that facilitates cash flow-based borrowing.},

The firm’s financing capacity is endogenously determined by either the liquidation value of assets (asset-based) or the intermediary’s going-concern valuation of the firm’s cash flows (cash flow-based). We implement the optimal contract between the firm and intermediary with both unsecured and secured debt (credit lines) in an overlapping pecking order: the firm simultaneously finances cash flow shortfalls with unsecured debt and either cash reserves (if available) or secured debt (otherwise). Improved access to equity financing increases debt capacity, thus debt and equity are dynamic complements. When the firm does well, it repays its debt in full, while when in distress, repayment dynamics mirror U.S. bankruptcy procedures.},

We organize our survey into four topics. Topic \#1 explores the characteristics of financial information used within the firm—the types of reports prepared, the level of performance measurement, and the internal and external parties that can access this information. The second and third topics examine firms producing GAAP financial statements. Topic \#2 asks about assurance choices, preparers, and the cost-effectiveness of specific standards. Topic \#3 examines how much influence various parties (e.g., banks, suppliers, equity investors, senior managers) exert on the firm’s decision to prepare GAAP financial statements, as well as the costs and benefits of providing statements to these parties. Our final topic studies firms that do not prepare GAAP financial statements, and explores this choice. All topics permit us to study cross-sectional variation related to ownership, financing choices, firm size, and accounting practice. We expect our study to advance research on management accounting, reporting, and auditing.},

The effect is weaker when rivals have more expertise in the local market, are less concerned about credit risk due to mortgage sales, and locate in areas with more alternative information about the CFPB banks. The effect is concentrated in severe complaints and complaints related to loan underwriting practices. In addition to approving more loans, rivals also open more branches and are more likely to post a job opening in these markets.

            We adapt simple tools from computational linguistics to construct a new measure of political risk faced by individual U.S. firms: the share of their quarterly earnings conference calls that they devote to political risks. We validate our measure by showing that it correctly identifies calls containing extensive conversations on risks that are political in nature, that it varies intuitively over time and across sectors, and that it correlates with the firm’s actions and stock market volatility in a manner that is highly indicative of political risk. Firms exposed to political risk retrench hiring and investment and actively lobby and donate to politicians. These results continue to hold after controlling for news about the mean (as opposed to the variance) of political shocks. Interestingly, the vast majority of the variation in our measure is at the firm level rather than at the aggregate or sector level, in the sense that it is captured neither by the interaction of sector and time fixed effects nor by heterogeneous exposure of individual firms to aggregate political risk. The dispersion of this firm-level political risk increases significantly at times with high aggregate political risk. Decomposing our measure of political risk by topic, we find that firms that devote more time to discussing risks associated with a given political topic tend to increase lobbying on that topic, but not on other topics, in the following quarter.},

This main result, when combined with our cross-sectional analyses, offers evidence suggesting that deregulation leads to less demand for higher quality auditors because (1) firms have increased access to credit, which reduces the benefits of higher audit quality; (2) entering banks’ lending expertise substitutes for higher quality financial statements; (3) incumbent banks with less lending expertise seek to protect their rents by preferring that borrowers provide lower quality financial statement information; and (4) external stakeholders delegate their monitoring to banks to a greater degree, resulting in less demand for higher quality financial statements.

            We quantify the real implications of trade-offs between firm information disclosure and long-term investment efficiency. We estimate a dynamic equilibrium model in which firm managers confront realistic incentives to misreport earnings and distort their real investment choices. The model implies a socially optimal level of disclosure regulation that exceeds the estimated value. Counterfactual analysis reveals that eliminating earnings misreporting completely through disclosure regulation incentivizes managers to distort real investment. Lower earnings informativeness raises the cost of capital, which results in a 5.7\${\textbackslash}\%\$ drop in average firm value, but more modest effects on social welfare and aggregate growth.

Disparities in PPP borrowing cannot be attributed to lower awareness of PPP loans or lower demand for PPP loans by minority-owned restaurants. We use a broader sample of firms that were likely eligible for PPP loans to show that our findings apply more broadly across industries and are not limited to Florida.

            Macro-finance analyses commonly link firms’ borrowing constraints to the liquidation value of physical assets. For U.S. nonfinancial firms, we show that 20\% of debt by value is based on such assets (asset-based lending in creditor parlance), whereas 80\% is based predominantly on cash flows from firms’ operations (cash flow–based lending). A standard borrowing constraint restricts total debt as a function of cash flows measured using operating earnings (earnings-based borrowing constraints). These features shape firm outcomes on the margin: first, cash flows in the form of operating earnings can directly relax borrowing constraints; second, firms are less vulnerable to collateral damage from asset price declines, and fire sale amplification may be mitigated. Taken together, our findings point to new venues for modeling firms’ borrowing constraints in macro-finance studies.},

Using two distinct measures of lender-specific shocks—defaults in a lender’s corporate loan portfolio that occur outside the borrower’s region and industry, and noncorporate loan delinquencies—we show that lenders respond to financial shocks by increasing the number and strictness of performance-based but not of capital-based covenants in debt contracts. We examine two possible channels for this result. We find evidence consistent with lenders using stricter control rights because of concerns about capital depletion (a capital channel) and because of new information about lenders’ own screening ability (a learning channel).

The major result of the multivariate tests is that highly leveraged borrowers are forced to negotiate agreements with both more numerous and tighter restrictions. Debt contracts represent a series of rational trade-offs. Firms with higher debt face more restrictions, which are tighter and more likely to restnct managerial actions. Similarly, borrowers are more likely to agree to tighter extensive restrictions in exchange for more substantial loans. The evidence also indicates that larger firms that possess greater resources to avoid default are able to negotiate looser agreements that contain fewer restrictions. Secured loans do not impose a large number of accounting-based restrictions on managements" actions because secured lenders have less need to restrict managements" options. However, longterm agreements, including insurance loans, include more restrictions on dividends and payout options but use covenant ratios to allow managemeni the flexibility needed over the course of a long-term loan.},

We quantify social media’s role in this distress using comprehensive Twitter data. During the SVB run period, banks in the top tercile of pre-run Twitter exposure lost 6.6 percentage points more stock market value, an effect unexplained by mark-to-market losses and uninsured deposits. Moreover, social media amplifies balance sheet risks and is associated with greater outflow of uninsured deposits during Q1 2023. During the run period, high Twitter message volume in the past four hours predicts hourly stock market losses, especially for banks with high balance sheet risk. At even higher frequency, negative sentiment tweets in the run period translate into immediate stock market losses. These high frequency effects are stronger for tweets with contagion keywords and tweets by tech startup users who are likely depositors in SVB.},

	abstract = {The United States has been experiencing a slowdown in measured labor productivity growth since 2004. A number of commentators and researchers have suggested that this slowdown is at least in part illusory because real output data have failed to capture the new and better products of the past decade. I conduct four disparate analyses, each of which offers empirical challenges to this “mismeasurement hypothesis.” First, the productivity slowdown has occurred in dozens of countries, and its size is unrelated to measures of the countries' consumption or production intensities of information and communication technologies (ICTs, the type of goods most often cited as sources of mismeasurement). Second, estimates from the existing research literature of the surplus created by internet-linked digital technologies fall far short of the \$3 trillion or more of “missing output” resulting from the productivity growth slowdown. Third, if measurement problems were to account for even a modest share of this missing output, the properly measured output and productivity growth rates of industries that produce and service ICTs would have to have been multiples of their measured growth in the data. Fourth, while measured gross domestic income has been on average higher than measured gross domestic product since 2004—perhaps indicating workers are being paid to make products that are given away for free or at highly discounted prices—this trend actually began before the productivity slowdown and moreover reflects unusually high capital income rather than labor income (i.e., profits are unusually high). In combination, these complementary facets of evidence suggest that the reasonable prima facie case for the mismeasurement hypothesis faces real hurdles when confronted with the data.},

            This paper finds that banks and nonbanks respond differently to increased competition in consumer credit markets. Increased competition and a greater threat of failure induces banks to specialize in relationship business lending, and surviving banks are more profitable. However, nonbanks change their credit policy when faced with more competition and expand credit to riskier borrowers at the extensive margin, resulting in higher default rates. These results show how the effects of competition depend on the form of intermediation. They also suggest that increased competition can cause credit risk to migrate outside the traditional supervisory umbrella.},

We ﬁnd that food labels increase consumer welfare by 1.8\% of total expenditure, and that these effects are enhanced by ﬁrms’ responses. We then use the model to study alternative policy designs. Under optimal policy thresholds, food labels and sugar taxes generate similar gains in consumer welfare, but food labels beneﬁt the poor relatively more.},

This argument follows from the critique he presented of existing models of capital structure and from the theory he outlined of the optimal aggregate capital structure of the economy as a whole. That theory depends on the existence of different marginal tax rates for individuals and a tax-free security. Professor Miller pointed out that he was motivated to develop his hypothesis by the apparent inadequacy of a (if not the most) popular explanation for capital structure at both the micro and the aggregate level: the tradeoff between the tax advantages of debt and the cost to the firm's security holders of the bankruptcy process. He observed that neither the tax advantage of debt nor the costs of bankruptcy may be quite what they seem at first glance. When the corporate income tax and the differential taxation of regular income and capital gains are taken into account, then the tax advantage of debt is reduced. Moreover, the limited empirical evidence from actual bankruptcies suggests that the real costs to security holders of bankruptcy may be really rather low. And the recent discussion by Haugen and Senbet [6] suggests that most of the costs attributed to bankruptcy are really costs of liquidation of the firm's assets and not relevant to the capital structure decision.},

@article{buchak_secular_2024,
	title = {The {Secular} {Decline} of {Bank} {Balance} {Sheet} {Lending}},
	abstract = {The traditional model of bank-led financial intermediation, where banks issue demandable deposits to savers and make informationally sensitive loans to borrowers, has seen a dramatic decline since 1970s. Instead, private credit is increasingly intermediated through arms-length transactions, such as securitization. This paper documents these trends, explores their causes, and discusses their implications for the financial system and regulation. We document that the balance sheet share of overall private lending has declined from 60\% in 1970 to 35\% in 2023, while the deposit share of savings has declined from 22\% to 13\%. Additionally, the share of loans as a percentage of bank assets has fallen from 70\% to 55\%. We develop a structural model to explore whether technological improvements in securitization, shifts in saver preferences away from deposits, and changes in implicit subsidies and costs of bank activities can explain these shifts. Declines in securitization cost account for changes in aggregate lending quantities. Savers, rather than borrowers, are the main drivers of bank balance sheet size. Implicit banks’ costs and subsidies explain shifting bank balance sheet composition. Together, these forces explain the fall in the overall share of informationally sensitive bank lending in credit intermediation. We conclude by examining how these shifts impact the financial sector’s sensitivity to macroprudential regulation. While raising capital requirements or liquidity requirements decreases lending in both early (1960s) and recent (2020’s) scenarios, the effect is less pronounced in the later period due to the reduced role of bank balance sheets in credit intermediation. The substitution of bank balance sheet loans with debt securities in response to these policies explains why we observe only a fairly modest decline in aggregate lending despite a large contraction of bank balance sheet lending. Overall, we find that the intermediation sector has undergone significant transformation, with implications for macroprudential policy and financial regulation.},

The optimal lender-investor contract can be implemented by requiring the lender to initially retain a share of the loan that it gradually sells to investors, rationalizing loan sales after origination.

Dealscan offers several advantages over the data available in previous studies, principally larger and more representative samples and the availability of extensive actual covenant detail. These advantages allow us to construct powerful tests in which we ﬁnd clear support for the debt covenant hypothesis. We also use these data to provide broad evidence on the economic role of debt covenants. We ﬁnd that private lenders set debt covenants tightly and use them as “trip wires” for borrowers, that technical violations occur relatively often, and that violations are not necessarily associated with ﬁnancial distress. Finally, since we measure covenant slack directly, we report evidence that the extensively-used leverage variable is a relatively noisy proxy for closeness to covenants.},

	abstract = {Using a sample of over 5,000 debt issues, I test whether ﬁrms with more extensive use of covenants in their public debt contracts exhibit timelier recognition of economic losses in accounting earnings. Covenants govern the transfer of decision-making and control rights from shareholders to bondholders when a company approaches ﬁnancial distress and thereby limit managers’ abilities to expropriate bondholder wealth. Covenants are expected to constrain managerial opportunism, however, only if the accounting system recognizes economic losses in earnings in a timely fashion. Thus, the demand for timely loss recognition should increase with a contract’s reliance on covenants. Consistent with this conjecture, I ﬁnd evidence that reliance on covenants in public debt contracts is positively associated with the degree of timely loss recognition. I also ﬁnd evidence that the presence of prior private debt mitigates this relationship.},

	title = {Bank {Capital} and the {Growth} of {Private} {Credit}},
	abstract = {This paper examines whether regulatory arbitrage can explain the growth of private credit. We find that business development companies (BDCs) — closed-end funds that provide a significant share of nonbank loans to middle market firms — are very well capitalized according to bank capital frameworks. They have average capital ratios of about 33\% and excess capital in severely stressed scenarios. Thus, private credit has not grown because nonbank financial intermediaries have to hold less capital than banks. Instead, we argue that banks find lending to BDCs to facilitate their middle market lending more attractive than making loans to middle market lending. This is, in part, because over-collateralized loans to BDCs and other nonbank financial intermediaries get relatively favorable capital treatment, enabling banks to exploit their low-cost funding. It is also attractive because the loans are relatively large and thus less costly to originate, underwrite, and service than a portfolio of middle market loans.},

            We ask whether the correlation between mortgage leverage and default is due to moral hazard (the causal effect of leverage) or adverse selection (ex ante risky borrowers choosing larger loans). We separate these information asymmetries using a natural experiment resulting from the contract structure of option adjustable-rate mortgages and unexpected 2008 divergence of indexes that determine rate adjustments. Our point estimates suggest that moral hazard is responsible for 40\${\textbackslash}\%\$ of the correlation in our sample, while adverse selection explains 60\${\textbackslash}\%\$. We calibrate a simple model to show that leverage regulation must weigh default prevention against distortions due to adverse selection.},

This stems partly from financial development giving creditors greater confidence that high-quality borrowers will respect their claims even if creditors do not obtain security upfront. Consequently, such borrowers prefer retaining financial flexibility by not giving security up front. Instead, security is given contingently—when a firm approaches distress. This also explains why, superimposed on the secular decline, the share of secured debt issued is countercyclical.},

Prior theory and evidence suggest that renegotiation considerations from coordination difficulties in large syndicates and intertemporal transfers due to relationship lending in small syndicates are factors in the design of covenants. I find that for large syndicates, borrowers and lenders avoid the use of flexibility-reducing covenants that are more likely to impact negatively on value-enhancing corporate policies (e.g., investments) in good states of the world. This effect becomes stronger when the borrower has fewer outside financing options. Additionally, I find that contracts with large syndicates are more likely to have more covenant slack, include performance pricing provisions, have tailored capital expenditure covenants that alleviate over- and underinvestment problems, and principally rely on covenants that are directly linked to the current performance of the borrower. Collectively, these results imply that syndicate size and related renegotiation considerations affect how accounting information is used in debt contracts.},

Renegotiations result in large changes to the amount, maturity, and pricing of the contract, occur relatively early in the life of the contract, and are rarely a consequence of distress or default. The accrual of new information concerning the credit quality, investment opportunities, and collateral of the borrower, as well as macroeconomic ﬂuctuations in credit and equity market conditions, are the primary determinants of renegotiation and its outcomes. The terms of the initial contract (e.g., contingencies) also play an important role in renegotiations; by altering the structure of the contract in a state contingent manner, renegotiation is partially controlled by the contractual assignment of bargaining power.},

We document that the sectoral composition of lenders financing a credit expansion is a key determinant for subsequent real activity and crisis probability. We show that banks and nonbanks respond differentially to changes in macroeconomic conditions, with bank credit more sensitive to economic downturns.

We summarize and test the implications for what we refer to as the Agency Theory of Covenants (ATC), using a large sample of privately placed corporate debt. Our results are consistent with many of the implications of the ATC, including a negative relation between the promised yield on corporate debt and the presence of covenants. We also find that borrower and lender characteristics, as well as macroeconomic factors, determine covenant structure. Loans are more likely to include protective covenants when the borrower is small, has high growth opportunities or is highly levered. Loans made by investment banks and syndicated loans are also more likely to include protective covenants, as are loans made during recessionary periods or when credit spreads are large. Finally, we show that consistent with the ATC, firms that elect to issue private rather than public debt are smaller, have greater growth opportunities, less long-term debt, fewer tangible assets, more volatile cash flows and include more covenants in their debt agreements. An important byproduct of our analysis is to demonstrate empirically that covenant structure and the yield on corporate debt are determined simultaneously.},

Much of this literature is highly technical and has not made inroads into empirical practic where many researchers continue to use simple methods such as ordinary least squares regression even in settings where those methods do not have attractive properties. In this paper, I discuss some of the lessons for practice from the theoretical literature and provide detailed recommendations on wha to do.

Our derivations take into account that the propensity score is itself estimated in a ﬁrst step, prior to matching. We prove that ﬁrst step estimation of the propensity score affects the large sample distribution of propensity score matching estimators, and derive adjustments to the large sample variances of propensity score matching estimators of the average treatment effect (ATE) and the average treatment effect on the treated (ATET). The adjustment for the ATE estimator is negative (or zero in some special cases), implying that matching on the estimated propensity score is more efﬁcient than matching on the true propensity score in large samples. However, for the ATET estimator, the sign of the adjustment term depends on the data generating process, and ignoring the estimation error in the propensity score may lead to conﬁdence intervals that are either too large or too small.},

            What is the economic role played by arrangers of leveraged loans, and what are the risks they face? We provide evidence that arrangers solve a demand discovery problem. Investors have incentives to feign little interest in the loan to obtain better terms. To deter such behavior, arrangers underprice hot deals and ration investors on cold deals. The risk associated with demand discovery is often shared between borrowers and arrangers. One implication is that to ration investors on cold deals, arrangers retain larger loan shares. This motive for retention is different from the monitoring incentive motive previously considered in the literature.},

The results also indicate that the relative importance of disclosures is greater in situations where there is greater market uncertainty about the firm as reflected by the variance of stock returns.

Results further show that non-banks, despite their specialization in lending to risky ﬁrms, cut credit to riskier borrowers by even more than banks.

Combining loan-level data from the Shared National Credit register with buyout deals from Pitchbook, we find that PE-backed loans feature lower bank monitoring, lower loan shares retained by the lead bank, and more loan sales to non-bank financial intermediaries. For PE-backed loans, the sponsor’s reputation and the strength of its relationship with the lead bank further reduce the lead bank’s retained share and monitoring. Our results suggest that PE sponsor engagement substitutes for bank monitoring, allowing banks to retain less skin-in-the game in the loans they originate and to sell greater loan shares to non-banks.},

However, upon covenant violation, PE-sponsored borrowers experience relatively smaller reductions in credit commitments, suggesting lenders are more lenient with these borrowers. This limited-punishment effect exists in both covenant-heavy and covenant-lite loans but is stronger for banks with relatively higher capital. Limited punishment is driven by repeated deals and sponsor reputation, as well as the higher bargaining power of sponsors in loan renegotiation.

After controlling for liquidity provision and characteristics investing, we find that a one standard deviation increase in share repurchases during a given quarter is associated with a 0.11 standard deviation decrease in institutional investor demand. We estimate that 37\% of the inverse relation is attributed to institutional investors executing liquidity provision strategies, 8\% is explained by institutions reacting to the investment characteristics signaled by a repurchasing firm. We attribute the majority, 55\%, to the information asymmetry between institutions and individual investors. This work is one of the first to exploit the SEC mandate requiring firms to report the actual number of shares they repurchase each quarter, beginning in 2004. Using actual number of shares repurchased, we find evidence of institutional investors increasing their selling as firms increase their repurchasing. This finding is robust to models of endogeneity and autocorrelation in share repurchases and institutional investor trading.},

The baseline textbook recommendation is to use the Present Value (PV) formula of expected cash flows, with a discount rate based on the CAPM. In this paper, we ask what is, empirically, the best discounting method. To do this, we study listed firms, whose actual prices and expected cash flows can be observed. We compare different discounting approaches on their ability to predict actual market prices. We find that discounting based on expected returns (such as variants on the CAPM or multi-factor model), performs very poorly. Discounting with an Implied Cost of Capital (ICC), imputed from comparable firms, obtains much better results. In terms of pricing methods, significant, but small, improvements can be obtained by allowing, in a simple and actionable way, for a more flexible term structure of expected returns. We benchmark all of our results with flexible, purely statistical models of prices based on Random Forest algorithms. These models do barely better than NPV-based methods. Finally, we show that under standard assumptions about the production function, the value loss from using the CAPM can be sizable, of the order of 10\%.},

Using the recent introduction of the Current Expected Credit Losses (CECL) standard, we examine whether uncertainty due to the lack of concurrent guidance from accounting standard setters and bank regulators on the implementation and implications of CECL had counterproductive real effects. We hypothesize and find that banks significantly reduce loan amounts and offer stricter loan terms for affected loan facilities (term loan As, or TLAs) during the uncertainty period compared to those of unaffected loan facilities (term loan Bs, or TLBs). Furthermore, we show that the uncertainty period’s reduced credit supply adversely affects investments for firms dependent exclusively on TLAs compared to other borrowers. Cross-sectional tests show that the effect is stronger for firms that are frequent borrowers and likely to face financial constraints. The findings indicate that non-concurrent guidance from different regulatory agencies may affect the smooth functioning of affected economic entities.},

	abstract = {Nonparametric methods play a central role in modern empirical work. While they provide inference procedures that are more robust to parametric misspecification bias, they may be quite sensitive to tuning parameter choices. We study the effects of bias correction on confidence interval coverage in the context of kernel density and local polynomial regression estimation, and prove that bias correction can be preferred to undersmoothing for minimizing coverage error and increasing robustness to tuning parameter choice. This is achieved using a novel, yet simple, Studentization, which leads to a new way of constructing kernel-based bias-corrected confidence intervals. In addition, for practical cases, we derive coverage error optimal bandwidths and discuss easy-to-implement bandwidth selectors. For interior points, we show that the mean-squared error (MSE)-optimal bandwidth for the original point estimator (before bias correction) delivers the fastest coverage error decay rate after bias correction when second-order (equivalent) kernels are employed, but is otherwise suboptimal because it is too “large.” Finally, for odd-degree local polynomial regression, we show that, as with point estimation, coverage error adapts to boundary points automatically when appropriate Studentization is used; however, the MSE-optimal bandwidth for the original point estimator is suboptimal. All the results are established using valid Edgeworth expansions and illustrated with simulated data. Our findings have important consequences for empirical work as they indicate that biascorrected confidence intervals, coupled with appropriate standard errors, have smaller coverage error and are less sensitive to tuning parameter choices in practically relevant cases where additional smoothness is available.

However, conditional on credit ratings, insurance portfolios are systematically biased toward higher yield, higher CDS bonds. This behavior is related to the business cycle being most pronounced during economic expansions. It is also characteristic of ﬁrms with poor corporate governance and for which the regulatory capital requirement is more binding.},

            We examine “reaching for yield” in U.S. corporate bond mutual funds. We define reaching for yield as tilting portfolios toward bonds with yields higher than the benchmarks. We find that funds generate higher returns and attract more inflows when they reach for yield, especially in periods of low-interest rates. Returns for high reaching-for-yield funds nevertheless tend to be negative on a risk-adjusted basis. Funds engage in rank-chasing behavior by reaching for yield, although these incentives are moderated by the illiquid nature of corporate bonds. High reaching-for-yield funds hold less cash and less liquid bonds, exacerbating redemption risks.

            We study the determinants of value creation in U.S. commercial banks. We develop novel measures of individual banks’ productivities at collecting deposits and making loans that we relate to bank market values. We find that deposit productivity is responsible for two-thirds of the value of the median bank and most variation in value across banks. Variation in productivity is driven by differences across banks in technology, customer demographics, and market power. We also find evidence of synergies between deposit-taking and lending. Our findings suggest that there is significant heterogeneity in banks’ ability to capture value by manufacturing safe assets.},

In the context of Medicare Advantage, I ﬁnd that consumers’ information is limited, and quality is ineﬃciently low. A simple design alleviates these issues and increases total welfare by 3.7 monthly premiums. More than half of the gains stem from scores’ eﬀect on quality rather than information. Scores can outperform full-information outcomes by regulating ineﬃcient oligopolistic quality provision, and a binary certiﬁcation of quality attains 98\% of this welfare. Scores are informative even when coarse; ﬁrms’ incentives are to produce quality at the scoring threshold, which consumers know. The primary design challenge of scores is to dictate thresholds and thus regulate quality.},

            We construct a novel panel data set to provide new evidence on how the largest nonfinancial firms manage their financial assets. Our granular data show that, over the past decade, bond portfolios have grown to be at least as large as cash-like instruments, driven by the meteoric rise of corporate bond holdings. To shed light on the drivers of this growth, we conduct a pair of event studies around the 2017 tax reform and the 2020 liquidity crisis. We find that large holdings of marketable securities are primarily driven by cross-border tax incentives, while cash-like instruments are driven by liquidity motives. (JEL G32, G35, G11, E440)},

	abstract = {A safe asset is a simple debt instrument that is expected to preserve its value during adverse systemic events. The supply of safe assets, private and public, has historically been concentrated in a small number of advanced economies, most prominently the United States. Over the last few decades, with minor cyclical interruptions, the supply of safe assets has not kept up with global demand. The reason is straightforward: the collective growth rate of the advanced economies that produce safe assets has been lower than the world's growth rate, which has been driven disproportionately by the high growth rate of high-saving emerging economies such as China. The signature of this growing shortage is a steady increase in the price of safe assets; equivalently, global safe interest rates must decline, as has been the case since the 1980s. The early literature, brought to light by Ben Bernanke's famous “savings glut” speech of 2005, focused on a general shortage of assets without isolating its safe asset component. The distinction, however, has become increasingly important over time, particularly in the aftermath of the subprime mortgage crisis and its sequels. We begin by describing the main facts and macroeconomic implications of safe asset shortages. Faced with such a structural conundrum, what are the likely short- to medium-term escape valves? We analyze four of them, each with its own macroeconomic and financial trade-offs.},

Investor specialization in certain bond types allows firms to effectively shape their bondholder composition through their issuance decisions. Firms with greater diversification in their bondholder composition exhibit increased resilience to credit market shocks. Our analysis reveals that firms time the market when issuing bonds. Market timing serves not only to minimize capital costs but also as a strategy for credit supply diversification.

            I find that shadow bank money creation significantly expands during monetary-tightening cycles. This “shadow banking channel” offsets reductions in commercial bank deposits and dampens the impact of monetary policy. Using a structural model of bank competition, I show that the difference in depositor clienteles quantitatively explains banks’ different responses to monetary policy. Facing a more yield-sensitive clientele, shadow banks are more likely to pass through rate hikes to depositors, thereby attracting more deposits when the Federal Reserve raises rates. My results suggest that monetary tightening could unintentionally increase financial fragility by driving deposits into the uninsured shadow banking sector.

            This article investigates the effect of bank lending frictions on employment outcomes. I construct a new data set that combines information on banking relationships and employment at 2,000 nonfinancial firms during the 2008–9 crisis. The article first verifies empirically the importance of banking relationships, which imply a cost to borrowers who switch lenders. I then use the dispersion in lender health following the Lehman crisis as a source of exogenous variation in the availability of credit to borrowers. I find that credit matters. Firms that had precrisis relationships with less healthy lenders had a lower likelihood of obtaining a loan following the Lehman bankruptcy, paid a higher interest rate if they did borrow, and reduced employment by more compared to precrisis clients of healthier lenders. Consistent with frictions deriving from asymmetric information, the effects vary by firm type. Lender health has an economically and statistically significant effect on employment at small and medium firms, but the data cannot reject the hypothesis of no effect at the largest or most transparent firms. Abstracting from general equilibrium effects, I find that the withdrawal of credit accounts for between one-third and one-half of the employment decline at small and medium firms in the sample in the year following the Lehman bankruptcy.},

            We find that regulators can implement identical rules inconsistently due to differences in their institutional design and incentives, and this behavior may adversely impact the effectiveness with which regulation is implemented. We study supervisory decisions of U.S. banking regulators and exploit a legally determined rotation policy that assigns federal and state supervisors to the same bank at exogenously set time intervals. Comparing federal and state regulator supervisory ratings within the same bank, we find that federal regulators are systematically tougher, downgrading supervisory ratings almost twice as frequently as do state supervisors. State regulators counteract these downgrades to some degree by upgrading more frequently. Under federal regulators, banks report worse asset quality, higher regulatory capital ratios, and lower return on assets. Leniency of state regulators relative to their federal counterparts is related to costly outcomes, such as higher failure rates and lower repayment rates of government assistance funds. The discrepancy in regulator behavior is related to different weights given by regulators to local economic conditions and, to some extent, differences in regulatory resources. We find no support for regulator self-interest, which includes “revolving doors” as a reason for leniency of state regulators.},

            We estimate perceptions about the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy rule from panel data on professional forecasts of interest rates and macroeconomic conditions. The perceived dependence of the federal funds rate on economic conditions varies substantially over time, in particular over the monetary policy cycle. Forecasters update their perceptions about the Fed’s policy rule in response to monetary policy actions, measured by high-frequency interest rate surprises, suggesting that they have imperfect information about the rule. Monetary policy perceptions matter for monetary transmission, as they affect the sensitivity of interest rates to macroeconomic news, term premia in long-term bonds, and the response of the stock market to monetary policy surprises. A simple learning model with forecaster heterogeneity and incomplete information about the policy rule motivates and explains our empirical findings.},

            This article studies the macroeconomic implications of imperfect risk sharing implied by a class of New Keynesian models with heterogeneous agents. The models in this class can be equivalently represented as a representative-agent economy with wedges. These wedges are functions of households’ consumption shares and relative wages, and they identify the key cross-sectional moments that govern the impact of households’ heterogeneity on aggregate variables. We measure the wedges using U.S. household-level data and combine them with a representative-agent economy to perform counterfactuals. We find that deviations from perfect risk sharing implied by this class of models account for only 7\% of output volatility on average but can have sizable output effects when nominal interest rates reach their lower bound.},

The high prices are sustained by collusive strategies with a finite phase of punishment followed by a gradual return to cooperation.

The guidance was effective at reducing banks’ leveraged lending activity, but it is less clear whether it accomplished its broader goal of reducing the risk that these loans pose for the stability of the financial system.

	abstract = {Theory offers conflicting predictions on whether and how lenders’ sectoral specialization would affect firms’ innovation activities. We show that the sign and magnitude of this effect vary with the degree of “asset overhang” across sectors, which is the risk that a new technology has negative spillovers on the value of a bank’s legacy loan portfolio. Using both patent data and micro-level innovation survey data, we find that lenders’ sectoral specialization improves innovation for firms operating in sectors with low asset overhang, but impedes innovation for firms operating in sectors with high asset overhang. These results hold for two distinct measures of asset overhang and using bank mergers as a source of exogenous variation in bank specialization. We further show that these heterogeneous effects arise through financial contracting. Overall, our findings provide novel insights into the dual facets of bank specialization and, more broadly, the link between banking and innovation.},

            The economic role of an accounting regime is to increase welfare through its effects—in conjunction with complementary institutions—on firm and household behavior.

One conclusion is that the partial correlations and average effects that predominate in this literature have provided valuable insights into the role of accounting in the economy, but provide limited and misleading proxies for welfare effects. A major concern is that teachers, students, and researchers—indeed, regulators and standard setters—raised on this literature could lose sight of, and underestimate, the fundamental contribution of accounting to aggregate welfare.},

We also show how microeconomic parameters are mapped to these reduced-form general equilibrium elasticities. In this sense, we extend the foundational theorem of Hulten (1978) beyond the ﬁrst order to capture nonlinearities. Key features ignored by ﬁrst-order approximations that play a crucial role are: structural microeconomic elasticities of substitution, network linkages, structural microeconomic returns to scale, and the extent of factor reallocation. In a business-cycle calibration with sectoral shocks, nonlinearities magnify negative shocks and attenuate positive shocks, resulting in an aggregate output distribution that is asymmetric (negative skewness), fattailed (excess kurtosis), and has a negative mean, even when shocks are symmetric and thin-tailed. Average output losses due to short-run sectoral shocks are an order of magnitude larger than the welfare cost of business cycles calculated by Lucas (1987). Nonlinearities can also cause shocks to critical sectors to have disproportionate macroeconomic effects, almost tripling the estimated impact of the 1970s oil shocks on world aggregate output. Finally, in a long-run growth context, nonlinearities, which underpin Baumol’s cost disease via the increase over time in the sales shares of low-growth bottleneck sectors, account for a 20 percentage point reduction in aggregate TFP growth over the period 1948–2014 in the United States.},

We provide evidence of two mechanisms for this result. First, cross-sectional and panel analyses are consistent with high-quality measurement as a management practice causing higher productivity. Second, using plausibly exogenous diﬀerences in misreporting incentives we show that external auditors attenuate reporting biases in administrative data. Thus we show that a portion of measured productivity heterogeneity is the direct result of reporting diﬀerences across ﬁrms. While short of identifying causal treatment eﬀects, the economic magnitude of our results suggests that ﬁrms’ accounting practices are an important area for explaining the vast heterogeneity in reported productivity.},

            This paper evaluates the role of accrual accounting in improving firms' production decisions and resource allocation across firms. I introduce two imperfect firm‐performance measures, cash flows and accounting earnings, into a general equilibrium model with heterogeneous firms under imperfect information. The model demonstrates that improvements in measurement systems lead to more informed decisions on the part of firms and ultimately to allocation of greater resources to high‐productivity firms via the product and input markets. Estimated parameter values are consistent with accrual accounting improving managers' information about current productivity by providing a better measure of historical firm performance. Quantitative analysis suggests that introducing accrual‐accounting information on top of cash‐accounting information leads to a 0.5\% increase in aggregate U.S. productivity and a 0.7\% increase in aggregate U.S. output via improved resource allocation. The corresponding estimates for China and India, as benchmarks for developing countries, are larger: a 1.5\% to 2.3\% increase in aggregate productivity and a 2.3\% to 3.4\% increase in aggregate output. I conclude that accrual accounting plays a significant role in determining aggregate productivity via improved resource allocation.},

An application to Chinese manufacturing firms reveals that adjustment costs and uncertainty, while significant, explain only a modest fraction of the dispersion, which stems largely from other factors: a component correlated with productivity and a fixed effect. Adjustment costs are more salient for large US firms, though other factors still account for the bulk of the dispersion. Technological/markup heterogeneity explains a limited fraction in China, but a potentially large share in the United States. (JEL D22, D24, D25, E22, G31, L60, O11, O14, O47, P31)},

            We propose a theory linking imperfect information to resource misallocation and hence to aggregate productivity and output. In our setup, firms look to a variety of noisy information sources when making input decisions. We devise a novel empirical strategy that uses a combination of firm-level production and stock market data to pin down the information structure in the economy. Even when only capital is chosen under imperfect information, applying this methodology to data from the United States, China, and India reveals substantial losses in productivity and output due to the informational friction. Our estimates for these losses range from 7\% to 10\% for productivity and 10\% to 14\% for output in China and India, and are smaller, though still significant, in the United States. Losses are substantially higher when labor decisions are also made under imperfect information. We find that firms turn primarily to internal sources for information; learning from financial markets contributes little, even in the United States.},

In this paper, we consider the role of information frictions. We posit that high-quality financial reporting with respect to firm productivity can mitigate information frictions and hence facilitate the efficient allocation of resources across firms. Using a large sample of firms in the manufacturing sector, we find evidence consistent with our prediction—industries with higher productivity informativeness tend to have smaller within-industry productivity dispersion. We further find that this relation is stronger in industries with greater dependence on external financing, suggesting that reporting quality affects allocation efficiency, at least in part, through the capital market channel. These findings suggest that the extent to which financial reporting is informative about productivity can affect resource allocation efficiency and hence have real effects at the macro level.},

            We investigate how the deregulation of the French banking industry in the 1980s affected the real behavior of firms and the structure and dynamics of product markets. Following deregulation, banks are less willing to bail out poorly performing firms and firms in the more bank‐dependent sectors are more likely to undertake restructuring activities. At the industry level, we observe an increase in asset and job reallocation, an improvement in allocative efficiency across firms, and a decline in concentration. Overall, these findings support the view that a more efficient banking sector helps foster a Schumpeterian process of “creative destruction.”},

Inspired by previous empirical findings, the model incorporates the feature that mandatory disclosure encourages (discourages) innovation by larger (smaller) firms. More importantly, I identify conditions for when expanding the scope of disclosure regulation increases aggregate innovation and/or welfare. I structurally estimate the model using innovation data and plausibly exogenous variation in the extent of disclosure regulation in Europe. My estimates suggest that subjecting 15\% more firms to full reporting requirements decreases aggregate innovation by around -0.26\% but increases welfare by around 1\%. This disparity is driven by the fact that production shifts to the larger firms that innovate less but can mass produce their innovations at scale.},

We find that less-capitalized banks reduce loan retention, particularly among loans with higher capital requirements and at times when capital is scarce, and nonbanks step in. This reallocation is associated with important adverse effects during the 2008 crisis: loans funded by nonbanks with fragile liabilities are less likely to be rolled over and experience greater price volatility.},

            We use a proprietary data set of financial statements collected by banks to examine whether economic growth is related to the use of financial statement verification in debt financing. Exploiting the distinct economic growth and contraction patterns of the construction industry over the years 2002–2011, our estimates reveal that banks reduced their collection of unqualified audited financial statements from construction firms at nearly twice the rate of firms in other industries during the housing boom period before 2008. This reduction was most severe in the regions that experienced the most significant construction growth. These trends reversed during the subsequent housing crisis in 2008–2011 when construction activity contracted. Moreover, using bank‐ and firm‐level data, we find a strong negative (positive) relation between audited financial statements during the growth period, and subsequent loan losses (construction firm survival) during the contraction period. Collectively, our results reveal that macroeconomic fluctuations produce temporal shifts in the overall level of financial statement verification and temporal shifts in verification are related to bank loan portfolio quality and borrower performance.},

We leverage statistical models that accommodate a broad set of (341) variables—outnumbering the total time-series observations—and apply machine learning techniques to train, validate, and test the prediction models. For near-term (current and next-quarter) GDP growth, accounting does not improve the out-of-sample accuracy of predictions because the professional forecasters’ predictions are relatively eﬃcient. Accounting’s predictive usefulness increases for more-distant-term (three- and four-quarters-ahead) GDP growth forecasts: they contribute more to the model’s predictions; moreover, their inclusion increases the model’s out-of-sample predictive accuracy by 13 to 46\%. Overall, four categories of accounting variables—relating to proﬁts, accrual estimates (e.g., loan loss provisions or write-oﬀs), capital raises or distributions, and capital allocation decisions (e.g., investments)—are most informative of the longer-term outlook of the economy.},

            In this study, we hypothesize and find that financial statement analysis of firm profitability drivers applied at the aggregate level yields timely insights that are relevant for forecasting real economic activity. We first show that focusing on the 100 largest firms offers a cost-effective way to extract information embedded in accounting profitability data of the entire stock market portfolio. We then show that accounting profitability data aggregated across the 100 largest firms have predictive content for subsequent real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth. We also show that stock market returns have predictive content for future real GDP growth, while their predictive power varies with the length of the measurement window with annual stock market returns being the most powerful. Importantly, we find that the predictive content of our indices of aggregate accounting profitability drivers is incremental to that of annual stock market returns. An in-depth investigation of consensus survey forecasts shows that professional macro forecasters revise their expectations of real economic activity in the direction of the predictive content of aggregate accounting profitability drivers and stock market returns. Although macro forecasters are fully attuned to stock market return data, their forecasts of real GDP growth can be improved in a statistically and economically significant way using our indices of aggregate accounting profitability drivers. Our findings suggest that professional macro forecasters and stock market investors do not fully impound the predictive content of aggregate accounting profitability drivers when forecasting real economic activity. In additional analysis, we examine the association between stock market returns and the portion of subsequent real GDP growth that is predictable based on our indices of aggregate accounting profitability drivers but that is not anticipated by stock market investors. We find that this portion is positively related to stock market returns, suggesting that the macro predictive content of aggregate accounting profitability drivers is relevant for stock valuation. Overall, our study brings financial statement analysis to the forefront as an incrementally useful tool for gauging the prospects of the real economy that should be of interest to academics and practitioners.

We then use the lens of the frame to survey the literature and speak to gaps in research knowledge. We uncover multiple roles for risk arguments influencing decarbonization. Moreover, decarbonization and green investment are tied to enhanced profitability through bank lending growth. Yet, the literature has many dots yet to connect.

Additionally, high data intensity plants issue forecasts that are less idiosyncratic and more like other plants within the firm as opposed to geographic peers, consistent with overreliance on readily available data crowding out incentives for managers to gather relevant local information.

            Using the implementation of the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval (EDGAR) system from 1993 to 1996 as a shock to information dissemination technologies, we examine how a significant reduction in disclosure processing costs affects the real economy. We find that the EDGAR implementation leads to an increase in corporate investment and that this effect is concentrated in value firms. We provide evidence that improved equity financing and enhanced managerial incentives are likely the underlying mechanisms. Specifically, the EDGAR implementation leads to an increase in a firm's stock liquidity, a decrease in the cost of equity capital, and an increase in the level of equity financing. Consistent with the monitoring effect of broad information dissemination, the EDGAR implementation leads to an increase in a firm's operating performance. Our findings suggest that it is important to consider information dissemination beyond information production when examining the real effects of corporate disclosures.},

            Modern information technologies have fundamentally changed how information is disseminated in financial markets. Using the staggered implementation of the EDGAR system from 1993 to 1996 as a shock to information dissemination technologies, we find evidence that internet dissemination of corporate disclosures increases information production by corporate outsiders. Trades by individual investors, especially those with access to the internet, become more informative about future stock returns following the EDGAR implementation. The amount and accuracy of information produced by sell-side analysts increase after the implementation. These results suggest that greater and broader information dissemination facilitated by modern information technologies improves information production. (JEL G12, G14)

            We show that analyst behavior changes in response to a randomly assigned shock that exogenously varies the timeliness and cost of accessing mandatory disclosures in the cross-section of investors: analysts reduce coverage and issue less optimistic, more accurate, less bold, and less informative forecasts. Our evidence indicates that analysts reduce a strategic component of their behavior: the changes are stronger among analysts with more strategic incentives like affiliated or retail-focused analysts. We conclude that mandatory disclosure can substitute for analyst information production, which is constrained by investors’ ability to verify forecasts using corporate filings.

              This paper examines the economic consequences of mandatory International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) reporting around the world. We analyze the effects on market liquidity, cost of capital, and Tobin's
              q
              in 26 countries using a large sample of firms that are mandated to adopt IFRS. We find that, on average, market liquidity increases around the time of the introduction of IFRS. We also document a decrease in firms' cost of capital and an increase in equity valuations, but only if we account for the possibility that the effects occur prior to the official adoption date. Partitioning our sample, we find that the capital‐market benefits occur
              only
              in countries where firms have incentives to be transparent and where legal enforcement is strong, underscoring the central importance of firms' reporting incentives and countries' enforcement regimes for the quality of financial reporting. Comparing mandatory and voluntary adopters, we find that the capital market effects are most pronounced for firms that voluntarily switch to IFRS, both in the year when they switch and again later, when IFRS become mandatory. While the former result is likely due to self‐selection, the latter result cautions us to attribute the capital‐market effects for mandatory adopters solely or even primarily to the IFRS mandate. Many adopting countries make concurrent efforts to improve enforcement and governance regimes, which likely play into our findings. Consistent with this interpretation, the estimated liquidity improvements are smaller in magnitude when we analyze them on a monthly basis, which is more likely to isolate IFRS reporting effects.},

Managers' unique disclosure styles are associated with observable demographic characteristics of their personal backgrounds: managers promoted from finance, accounting, and legal career tracks, managers born before World War II, and those with military experience develop disclosure styles dis playing certain conservative characteristics; and managers from finance and account ing and those with military experience favor more precise disclosure styles. These plausible associations confirm that our estimated manager-specific fixed effects capture systematic long-lived differences in managers' unique disclosure styles.},

            In 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission enacted the Securities Offering Reform (Reform), which relaxes “gun‐jumping” restrictions, thereby allowing firms to more freely disclose information before equity offerings. We examine the effect of the Reform on voluntary disclosure behavior before equity offerings and the associated economic consequences. We find that firms provide significantly more preoffering disclosures after the Reform. Further, we find that these preoffering disclosures are associated with a decrease in information asymmetry and a reduction in the cost of raising equity capital. Our findings not only inform the debate on the market effect of the Reform, but also speak to the literature on the relation between voluntary disclosure and information asymmetry by examining the effect of quasi‐exogenous changes in voluntary disclosure on information asymmetry, and thus a firm's cost of capital.},

            This study examines whether requiring the disclosure of audited financial statements disciplines managers’ mergers and acquisitions (M\&As) decisions. When an M\&A transaction meets certain disclosure thresholds, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires the public acquirer to disclose the target's audited financial statements after the merger is completed. Using hand‐collected data, I find that the disclosure of private targets’ financial statements is associated with better acquisition decisions. Furthermore, I find that this disciplining effect of disclosure is more pronounced when monitoring by outside capital providers is more difficult and costly, and when other disciplining mechanisms are weaker. Finally, these findings are robust to several alternative explanations, such as monitoring from blockholders and voluntary disclosures. In sum, the evidence suggests that the ex post mandatory disclosure of private targets’ accounting information disciplines managers’ acquisition decisions and improves acquisition efficiency.},

            Using the adoption of SFAS 131, I examine the effect of segment disclosure transparency on internal capital market efficiency. SFAS 131 requires firms to define segments as internally viewed by managers, thereby improving the transparency of managerial actions in internal capital allocation. I find that diversified firms that improved segment disclosure transparency by changing segment definitions upon adoption of SFAS 131 experienced an improvement in capital allocation efficiency in internal capital markets after the adoption of SFAS 131. In addition, I find that the improvement in internal capital market efficiency was greater for firms that suffered more severe agency problems before the adoption of SFAS 131 and also for firms whose managers faced stronger incentives to improve efficiency after the adoption of SFAS 131. My results suggest that more transparent segment information can help resolve agency conflicts in the internal capital markets of diversified firms, thus improving investment efficiency.},

Many critics argue that the frequent trading and short-term focus of institutional investors encourages managers to engage in such myopic investment behavior. Others argue that the large stockholdings and sophistication of institutions allow managers to focus on long-term value rather than on short-term earnings. I examine these competing views by testing whether institutional ownership affects R\&D spending for firms that could reverse a decline in earnings with a reduction in R\&D. The results indicate that managers are less likely to cut R\&D to reverse an earnings decline when institutional ownership is high, implying that institutions are sophisticated investors who typically serve a monitoring role in reducing pressures for myopic behavior. However, I find that a large proportion of ownership by institutions that have high portfolio turnover and engage in momentum trading significantly increases the probability that managers reduce R\&D to reverse an earnings decline. These results indicate that high turnover and momentum trading by institutional investors encourages myopic investment behavior when such institutional investors have extremely high levels of ownership in a firm; otherwise, institutional ownership serves to reduce pressures on managers for myopic investment behavior.},

	abstract = {Today's widespread criticism of U.S. companies as shortsighted and ever willing to sacrifice their future for near‐term profit is by no means new. As the author of this article shows, such charges of short‐termism have a long history that goes back at least 40 years. But as he goes on to point out, if these claims were warranted, then the effects we have been warned about all these years would surely have shown up by now.
            But it is difficult to find evidence of such effects. For example, a short‐term orientation has not been reflected in any erosion of corporate profitability over time. As the author reports, the ratio of U.S. corporate profits as a percentage of U.S. GDP has not only been on a generally upward trend since the early 1980s, but has never been higher than in the past few years. And corporate spending on R\&D has also gone up sharply during this period, from 1.1\% of GDP in 1977 to 1.7\% in 2016. What's more, evidence of short‐termism has not shown up in either higher amounts of investment, or higher rates of return, by venture capitalists and private equity firms, which are both in a good position to profit from widespread corporate failure to pursue valuable growth opportunities.
            Nor do stock market investors appear to encourage corporate short‐termism, given their willingness to fund IPOs of companies with no previous earnings, and to assign high price‐earnings multiples to companies, like Amazon and Tesla, whose reported earnings have been modest at best. What's more, the fact that today's P/E and CAPE ratios are at relatively high levels suggests that the market continues to expect significant rates of growth by U.S. companies.
            Some critics, to be sure, have argued that the high level of corporate buybacks and other distributions of cash, when combined with today's near‐record corporate cash holdings, provide clear evidence of a widespread failure of companies to invest in their future. But as the author notes, such distributions in fact represent a fairly small fraction—only around 20\%—of after‐tax corporate net income after infusions of new debt and equity capital are also taken into account.},

First, I ﬁnd that changes in GAAP affect investment, particularly R\&D expenditures, when ﬁrms have ﬁnancial covenants that are affected by changes in GAAP. Second, I ﬁnd evidence suggesting that the process of complying with some changes in GAAP alters managers’ information sets and consequently changes their investment decisions, particularly their capital and R\&D expenditures and, to a weaker extent, their acquistion expenditures. This paper contributes to the literature on the real effects of accounting by providing evidence that accounting rules affect investment decisions even when the rule change does not concern the measurement and reporting of investment, and by documenting speciﬁc mechanisms through which the relation manifests.},

	abstract = {This paper examines the effect of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) international inspection program on companies’ financing and investing decisions. Estimates from difference-in-differences regressions suggest that companies respond to their auditor receiving a ‘deficiency-free’ inspection report by issuing additional external capital amounting to 1.4\% of assets and increasing investment by 0.5\% of assets. These effects are larger for (i) financially constrained companies and (ii) companies located in countries where there is no audit regulator or the audit regulator does not conduct inspections. Further, the effect on financing decisions is stronger in countries with (i) low corruption, (ii) strong rule of law, and (iii) high regulatory quality. Descriptive evidence suggests that inspections increase the use of financial covenants in debt contracts, which is likely one of the mechanisms through which inspections generate real effects. This paper documents the value of PCAOB inspections in mitigating financing frictions for non-U.S. companies.},

            We show that negative policy rates affect the supply of bank credit in a novel way. Banks are reluctant to pass on negative rates to depositors, which increases the funding cost of high-deposit banks, and reduces their net worth, relative to low-deposit banks. As a consequence, the introduction of negative policy rates by the European Central Bank in mid-2014 leads to more risk-taking and less lending by euro-area banks with a greater reliance on deposit funding. Our results suggest that negative rates are less accommodative and could pose a risk to financial stability, if lending is done by high-deposit banks.

	abstract = {Mutual funds hold 32\% of the U.S. equity market and comprise 58\% of retirement savings, yet retail investors consistently make poor choices when selecting funds. Theory suggests poor choices are partially due to fund managers creating unnecessarily complex disclosures and fee structures to keep investors uninformed and obfuscate poor performance. An empirical challenge in investigating this “strategic obfuscation” theory is isolating manipulated complexity from complexity arising from inherent differences across funds. We examine obfuscation among S\&P 500 index funds, which have largely the same regulations, risks, and gross returns but charge widely different fees. Using bespoke measures of complexity designed for mutual funds, we find evidence consistent with funds attempting to obfuscate high fees. This study improves our understanding of why investors make poor mutual fund choices and how price dispersion persists among homogeneous index funds. We also discuss insights for mutual fund regulation and academic literature on corporate disclosures.},

            We study the personal credit market using unique individual-level data covering fintech and traditional lenders. We show that fintech lenders acquire market share by lending first to higher-risk borrowers and then to safer borrowers, and rely mainly on hard information to make credit decisions. Fintech borrowers are significantly more likely to default than neighbor individuals with the same characteristics borrowing from traditional financial institutions. Furthermore, they tend to experience a short-lived reduction in the cost of credit, because their indebtedness increases more than non-fintech borrowers after loan origination. However, fintech lenders’ pricing strategies are likely to take this into account.},

Without commitment, the all-equity bank sells loans and reduces monitoring over time. Short-term debt encourages the intermediary to retain loans and incentivizes monitoring. Our analysis provides a novel mechanism for intermediaries’ reliance on short-term debt—the constant repricing of debt creates incentives that resolve the commitment problem in loan retention and monitoring.},

We find that firms overinvest to accommodate earnings management and underutilize debt, hoarding cash, to preserve flexibility when profitable opportunities arise. The corporate finance literature finds that individual firm investment and debt issuance exhibit coincident spikes in the data but has difficulty rationalizing this fact. We find that a model that allows for accounting discretion better fits these spikes in the data than a model that does not.

We also ﬁnd evidence that managers use the added discretion provided by principles-based standards to manage earnings when ﬁrms are near bankruptcy, issuing equity, or experiencing high growth, and if earnings are near prominent earnings benchmarks. Overall, our evidence is consistent with managers using the discretion provided by principles-based standards to communicate better the economic substance of transactions, on average, but also with some managers using the added discretion strategically when managerial incentives exist to increase reported earnings.},

Using the setting of Big N auditors’ acquisitions of nonBig Ns, which increased investor response to earnings for the acquired client ﬁrms, we ﬁnd evidence supporting myopic investments. Speciﬁcally, acquired clients decrease intangible investments, particularly when (1) the increase in investor response to earnings is larger and (2) the horizon of shareholders is shorter.

            We examine whether managers provide more voluntary disclosure when GAAP limits their reporting discretion in financial statements. We find managers are more likely to disclose non‐GAAP earnings, issue more management forecasts, and provide longer yet more readable management discussion and analysis (MD\&A) disclosures when GAAP limits their discretion. These effects are stronger when there is greater demand for information and better monitoring. In contrast, these effects are weaker when managers have incentives to manage earnings. Difference‐in‐differences analyses around standard changes provide further evidence that managers make more non‐GAAP adjustments and are more likely to discuss the standard and its underlying transaction in the MD\&A when a new standard limits their discretion more than its predecessor. Collectively, our results suggest managers use voluntary disclosure channels to convey information when GAAP limits their ability to recognize such information in financial statements.},

We show that the internal agency problem is ameliorated by expanding discretion, and we exhibit examples where expanding discretion is undesirable when the internal and external agency problems are present concurrently and the nonexpense-related components of earnings are measured with error. We establish that expanding discretion is welfare-enhancing if either the manager's contract is publicly observable or else the nonexpense-related components of earnings are measured without error.

In this paper, I offer a model of debt covenant amendments and structurally estimate it using data on amendments of financial covenants in U.S. companies’ loan contracts. The model highlights three forces driving financial covenant amendments: (1) the degree of contractual incompleteness is high, (2) the non-contractible post-contract information is highly informative, and (3) the costs of amendments are small relative to the costs of misallocating control rights. I find that loan contracts are indeed highly incomplete and amendments are indeed substantially cheaper than misallocation of control rights. The non-contractible post-contract information is somewhat informative. I calculate that the amendment option ex ante saves about 2.32\% of control misallocation cost.},

Using data on banks’ internal borrower credit ratings, we first find evidence of discontinuities that suggest optimistic bias at salient thresholds in the ratings distribution. Next, we provide evidence that the discontinuities are less pronounced for public borrowers relative to private borrowers. Using an implied credit-ratings model, we find that both optimistic ratings bias and ratings dispersion across banks are reduced for borrowers with better financial reporting quality. These results suggest that borrower financial reporting quality facilitates bank examiner detection of internal ratings bias and may therefore be an important factor to consider in the current regulatory debate concerning which of a bank’s exposures should be eligible for the IRB approach. Finally, while controlling for borrower financial reporting quality we show that optimistic ratings bias is associated with lower interest spreads on associated loans, suggesting that banks' capital adequacy benefits from optimistic ratings bias may come at the cost of forgone interest.},

Lending increases with social connectedness, particularly in the presence of strong screening incentives. If connectedness is high, banks discriminate between borrowers more, the terms of originated loans are more borrower friendly, and loan performance is better. Furthermore, social connectedness is associated with higher bank profitability and with lending-related increases in borrower-region GDP growth and employment. Our results suggest that lending barriers decrease with social connectedness, which helps our understanding of geographic lending patterns and regional economic disparities.},

	abstract = {Social networks can shape many aspects of social and economic activity: migration and trade, job-seeking, innovation, consumer preferences and sentiment, public health, social mobility, and more. In turn, social networks themselves are associated with geographic proximity, historical ties, political boundaries, and other factors. Traditionally, the unavailability of large-scale and representative data on social connectedness between individuals or geographic regions has posed a challenge for empirical research on social networks. More recently, a body of such research has begun to emerge using data on social connectedness from online social networking services such as Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter. To date, most of these research projects have been built on anonymized administrative microdata from Facebook, typically by working with coauthor teams that include Facebook employees. However, there is an inherent limit to the number of researchers that will be able to work with social network data through such collaborations. In this paper, we therefore introduce a new measure of social connectedness at the US county level. Our Social Connectedness Index is based on friendship links on Facebook, the global online social networking service. Specifically, the Social Connectedness Index corresponds to the relative frequency of Facebook friendship links between every county-pair in the United States, and between every US county and every foreign country. Given Facebook’s scale as well as the relative representativeness of Facebook’s user body, these data provide the first comprehensive measure of friendship networks at a national level.},

We further support our ﬁndings by instrumenting banks’ AI-related hiring activity with their proximity to AI research institutions.

We argue that robustness is a central concern for this structural literature and discuss ways to analyze robustness in structural estimation (using well-identified moments and analyzing sensitivity to moments). The second approach relies on sufficient statistics, namely formulas that measure misallocation using simple empirical statistics and that are valid for a class of models. We discuss key contributions in that space, the generality of this approach, and the conditions under which it is valid. Sufficient statistic approaches are simpler and more robust, but they come at a cost: The range of counterfactual analyses that can be explored is more limited.},

We document sizable real effects of the shutdown: a \$1 reduction in EXIM trade financing reduces exports by approximately \$4.50. EXIM-dependent firms also experience a contraction in total revenues, investment, and employment. EXIM’s shutdown has the largest effects for exporters facing financing frictions and selling to markets with high contractual frictions, indicating that even in well-developed financial markets, trade financing can be under-supplied by private banks. Consistent with the idea that EXIM support can help to address market frictions, we find that the shutdown increased capital misallocation, as firms with a higher ex-ante marginal revenue product of capital contracted more. These results provide a framework for the conditions under which Export Credit Agencies can boost exports and firm growth, and can act as a tool of industrial policy without necessarily leading to a misallocation of resources.},

So I build and estimate a quantitative endogenous growth model in which short‐termism arises naturally as discipline on conflicted managers and boosts firm value by about 1\%. But short‐termism reduces R\&D, and the social return to R\&D is higher than the private return due to standard channels including knowledge spillovers and imperfect competition.

Analyses of cross-industry differences, deal-level data, and post-deal performance indicate that financial disclosure increases M\&A activity by reducing information frictions in the market for corporate control.

	title = {Arbitration with {Uninformed} {Consumers}},
	abstract = {This article studies the impact of the arbitrator selection process on consumer outcomes. Using data from consumer arbitration cases in the securities industry over the past two decades, where we observe detailed information on case characteristics, the randomly generated list of potential arbitrators presented to both parties, the selected arbitrator, and case outcomes, we establish several motivating facts. These facts suggest that firms hold an informational advantage over consumers in selecting arbitrators, resulting in industry-friendly arbitration outcomes. We then develop and calibrate a quantitative model of arbitrator selection in which firms hold an informational advantage in selecting arbitrators. Arbitrators, who are compensated only if chosen, compete with each other to be selected. The model allows us to decompose the firms’ advantage into two components: the advantage of choosing pro-industry arbitrators from a given pool and the equilibrium pro-industry tilt in the arbitration pool that arises because of arbitrator competition. Selecting arbitrators without the input of firms and consumers would increase consumer awards by \$60,000 on average relative to the current system. Forty percent of this effect arises because the pool of arbitrators skews pro-industry due to competition. Even an informed consumer cannot avoid this pro-industry equilibrium effect. Counterfactuals suggest that redesigning the arbitrator selection mechanism for the benefit of consumers hinges on whether consumers are informed. Policies intended to benefit consumers, such as increasing arbitrator compensation or giving parties more choice, would benefit informed consumers but hurt the uninformed.},

Many of the known costs and benefits of standardization have gone unmeasured and, as a result, there have been no efforts to quantitatively identify an efficient level of accounting standardization. Without guidance from researchers, the level of accounting standardization is set according to the intuition of standard-setters. Using data on a large cross-section of occupations, I provide evidence that the level of standardization in financial reporting occupations is far higher than would be expected given their characteristics. I then show with time-series data that the breadth of professional accounting discourse declined during the late 20th century, coincident with increases in the output of standard-setters. A lower quality discourse is one of many possible consequences of inefficient standardization.},

We analyze the macroeconomic implications of sticky discount rates using a New Keynesian model. The model naturally generates investment-consumption comovement in response to household demand shocks and higher investment in response to government spending. Sticky discount rates imply that inflation has real effects, even absent other nominal rigidities, making them a distinct source of monetary nonneutrality. At the same time, sticky discount rates make the short-term interest rate less effective at stimulating investment. Optimal monetary policy focuses on inflation expectations and permanently lowers the long-run inflation target in response to expansionary shocks, even when shocks are temporary.},

            Marketing and distribution expenses are responsible for about one-third of the cost of active management in the mutual fund industry. Estimating a structural model with costly investor search and learning about fund skill, we find that marketing is nearly as important as performance and fees in determining fund size. Eliminating marketing substantially improves welfare: capital shifts toward cheaper funds and competition decreases fees; active funds shrink and capital allocation becomes more closely aligned with skill. Declining investor search costs imply a reduction in marketing expenses and management fees as well as a shift toward passive investing, as observed empirically.},

            We analyze changes to mutual funds’ self-declared benchmarks using hand-collected data from funds’ prospectuses. Under existing rules, funds can freely change their benchmark indexes and, implicitly, the historical returns to which they compare their past performance. Funds exploit this loophole by adding (dropping) indexes with lower (higher) past returns, thereby materially improving the appearance of their benchmark-adjusted returns. High-fee funds, broker-sold funds, and funds experiencing poor performance and outflows are more likely to engage in this behavior. These funds subsequently attract additional flows despite continuing to underperform their peers.},

            We analyze the effectiveness of consumer financial regulation by considering the 2009 Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure (CARD) Act. We use a panel data set covering 160 million credit card accounts and a difference-in-differences research design that compares changes in outcomes over time for consumer credit cards, which were subject to the regulations, to changes for small business credit cards, which the law did not cover. We estimate that regulatory limits on credit card fees reduced overall borrowing costs by an annualized 1.6\% of average daily balances, with a decline of more than 5.3\% for consumers with FICO scores below 660. We find no evidence of an offsetting increase in interest charges or a reduction in the volume of credit. Taken together, we estimate that the CARD Act saved consumers \$11.9 billion a year. We also analyze a nudge that disclosed the interest savings from paying off balances in 36 months rather than making minimum payments. We detect a small increase in the share of accounts making the 36-month payment value but no evidence of a change in overall payments.},

	abstract = {This paper examines whether mandatory disclosure affects the extent to which ﬁrms learn from external market participants. Conventional wisdom suggests that mandatory disclosure should increase the total amount of information in ﬁnancial markets. However, disclosure can also reduce investors' incentives to acquire and produce information. Using the JOBS Act to identify variations in disclosure requirements, this paper ﬁnds that ﬁrms with reduced disclosure requirements attract more informed investors and learn more from ﬁnancial markets than those with stricter disclosure requirements. This learning is concentrated among ﬁrms that attract sophisticated investors, particularly those with industry expertise, and weakens once ﬁrms are forced to disclose more information. Overall, the results suggest that one beneﬁt from regulators’ recent efforts to reduce U.S. ﬁrm disclosure requirements is an increase in ﬁrm learning.},

We argue that mandatory portfolio disclosures reduce fund managers' incentive to collect and trade on private information, which reduces the stock price informativeness of their portfolio, and thus portfolio ﬁrm managers' ability to learn from their ﬁrms' stock prices. Using a difference-in-differences design around the May 2004 SEC regulation requiring more frequent fund disclosure, we ﬁnd that investment sensitivity to stock price declines for ﬁrms with signiﬁcant ownership held by actively managed funds affected by the regulation. The decline in investment-price sensitivity is concentrated among ﬁrms that are (i) owned by funds with larger expected proprietary costs and (ii) more likely to learn from price. Our results suggest that portfolio disclosure requirements have spillover effects on corporate investment by curtailing managers’ opportunities to learn from price.},

            We develop a return variance decomposition model to distinguish the roles of different types of information and noise in stock price movements. We disentangle four components: noise, private firm-specific information revealed through trading, firm-specific information revealed through public sources and market-wide information. Overall, we find that 31\${\textbackslash}\%\$ of the return variance is from noise, 24\${\textbackslash}\%\$ from private firm-specific information, 37\${\textbackslash}\%\$ from public firm-specific information and 8\${\textbackslash}\%\$ from market-wide information. Since the mid-1990s, there has been a dramatic decline in noise and an increase in firm-specific information, consistent with increasing market efficiency.

            We explore the use of voluntary disclosure by managers to solicit market feedback. Using managerial capital expenditure forecasts, we find that managers adjust annual capital expenditures upward (downward) in response to positive (negative) stock market reactions to capital expenditure forecasts, but only for those forecast announcements that stimulate rather than discourage informed trading. These capex adjustments motivated by market feedback correlate with higher future performance and are stronger (weaker) when outsiders (managers) are more informed. Finally, we show that managers are more likely to issue and learn from capex forecasts when predisclosure stock prices are affected by transitory nonfundamental shocks.},

Using additions to the MSCI index and the U.S. Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act as exogenous shocks to foreign ownership, we show that greater foreign ownership increases stock price informativeness, especially in developed economies. This increase arises from new information that foreign investors bring in and displacement of less-informed domestic retail investors. Finally, we show that foreign ownership, particularly from active investors, increases market liquidity, reduces firms’ cost of equity, and increases firms’ real investment growth.},

This ﬁnding is based on a new measure of investor-level informativeness that identiﬁes which investors are more informed about future proﬁtability.

However, this strategic reaction only counteracts two-thirds of the impact of the initial change in behavior.

A merger is 0.64 percentage points (16.6\% of the average) more likely to be withdrawn when abnormal social media sentiment following its announcement is a standard deviation lower. This effect is unexplained by abnormal price reactions, traditional news, and analyst recommendations. The informativeness of the social media signal strengthens after a firm adopts a corporate Twitter account, consistent with a learning channel. The informativeness is driven by tweets that are longer, written by fundamental investors and are acquisition-related, rather than meme tweets and tweets about price trends. It is strongest for complex mergers and in volatile markets when the value of listening to external, non-market feedback is greatest.

In the case of a proposed strategy change, we show that managers can extract the capital market’s information by announcing a potential new strategy, and then conditioning the decision to implement the new strategy on the size of the market’s price reaction to the announcement. Under this arrangement, we show that a necessary condition to implement all and only positive net present value strategy changes is that managers proceed to implement some strategies that garner negative price reactions upon their announcement. In the case of deciding whether to continue with a previously implemented strategy change, we show that it may be optimal for the ﬁrm to predicate its abandonment/continuation decision on the magnitude of the costs it has already incurred.

Compared to human articles, AI articles elicit smaller trading volume and abnormal return responses, suggesting they are less informative to capital market participants. However, authors who adopt AI exhibit increased productivity, publishing more articles and covering more new firms than non-adopters. Moreover, the expansion of AI coverage is associated with improved liquidity for historically undercovered firms, but provides no incremental benefit for firms that are already well-covered. Our findings suggest that while AI-generated articles are currently perceived as less informative than human-written articles, their comparatively low cost may enable broader coverage of, and capital market benefits for, firms traditionally overlooked by capital market intermediaries.},

Second, over the prolonged period preceding ChatGPT’s wide-deployment, short sellers had already been trading in alignment with AI-sentiment following earnings calls, while retail traders had not. Postdeployment, retail traders’ alignment increases up to 23-fold, while short sellers’ alignment can diminish. Third, stocks with higher retail-AI alignment witness significant bid-ask spread reductions. Fourth, exogenous ChatGPT outages notably reduce retail-AI alignment and reverse bid-ask spread improvements. Fifth, AI-sentiment provides investors with long-term return insights by leveraging long-text context and discerning between genuinely and excessively positive HD-sentiment.

We then formalize these survey-based insights using a stylized theoretical model to generate corroborating predictions. Finally, partnering with a technology firm that provides AI-based accounting software, we analyze unique field data from 79 small- and mid-sized firms, covering hundreds of thousands of transactions. We document significant productivity gains among AI adopters, including a 55\% increase in weekly client support and a reallocation of approximately 8.5\% of accountant time from routine data entry toward high-value tasks such as business communication and quality assurance. AI usage further corresponds to improved financial reporting quality, evidenced by a 12\% increase in general ledger granularity and a 7.5-day reduction in monthly close time. We also find complementarities between AI and accountant expertise: experienced professionals selectively leverage AI automation and expertise increases intervention when AI confidence scores signal uncertainty. Preliminary analysis from a supplementary pilot framed field experiment sheds light on the potential impact of AI errors. Overall, our findings highlight AI’s role in potentially augmenting, rather than replacing, professional accounting expertise.},

Moreover, user activity increases on days with financial disclosures, but these increases largely parallel media coverage. In addition, we find suggestive evidence of a substitutive relationship between informative management disclosures and GenAI usage. At the answer level, user fixed effects explain most variation in answer attributes, with more accurate trading signals linked to positive feedback and continued engagement. Finally, GenAI usage is associated with more informed trading, lower liquidity, and aggregated answer sentiment correlates with same-day abnormal returns. Overall, we provide comprehensive descriptive evidence on how users rely on GenAI to acquire information for stock market investment, offering practical insights for GenAI providers, firms, and regulators into how to cater to the informational demands of (retail) investors.},

	abstract = {Recent work within accounting and finance has highlighted that modern AI systems exhibit superhuman performance on a variety of foundational activities within these fields. However, the literature often does not provide economic rationale for why AI models seem to outperform, largely because these models are a black box. Through a series of experiments, I set out to open the black box and provide direct evidence on how and why AI models appear to perform so well on accounting and finance-related tasks. I show that much of the superior performance of AI models can be attributed to artifacts of the modeling itself, rather than to mechanisms grounded in economics. Focusing on two key components of AI models which may bias inferences in papers which rely on them, I first show that LLMs exhibit extremely poor numerical reasoning and thus application in these settings should proceed with caution. Second, I highlight that commercial LLMs suffer from significant look-ahead bias, which may explain a large portion of their predictability in various settings. In the final part of the paper, I highlight numerous opportunities where AI systems can advance our research.},

	abstract = {We explore the economic effects of biodiversity loss by developing an ecologically-founded model of how different species interact to deliver the ecosystem services that contribute to economic production. Ecosystem services are produced by combining several complementary ecosystem functions such as pollination and water filtration, which are each provided by several substitutable species. It follows that economic output is an increasing but concave function of species richness, and the economic cost of losing a species depends on: (i) how many redundant species remain within its ecosystem function, (ii) how critical the affected function is for overall ecosystem productivity, and (iii) the extent to which ecosystem services constrain economic output relative to other factors of production. We derive an expression for the fragility of ecosystems and economic output to further biodiversity loss, and decompose this fragility into within-function and across-function effects. Ecosystem fragility increases with both mean species losses as well as the imbalance of species losses across ecosystem functions. Consistent with the model, we show that empirical measures of biodiversity degradation and ecosystem fragility are reflected in market assessments of risk in the cross-section of countries, which we extract from the prices of credit default swaps. We conclude by embedding our model of ecosystem services production in an intertemporal planning problem and study optimal land use when land use raises output at the cost of reducing biodiversity.},

It brings a broader perspective on important frictions in insurance markets, including trust between insurers and policyholders, conflicts of interest among brokers, suboptimal policyholder behavior, and risk-based capital regulation. Several developments in the economy and the academic literature have provided an impetus for new perspectives, including the growth of savings products with minimum return guarantees, the global financial crisis, and intermediary asset pricing.

            We analyze the effects of a reform of capital regulation for U.S. insurance companies in 2009. The reform eliminates capital buffers against unexpected losses associated with portfolio holdings of MBS, but not for other fixed-income assets. After the reform, insurance companies are much more likely to retain downgraded MBS compared to other downgraded assets. This pattern is more pronounced for financially constrained insurers. Exploiting discontinuities in the reform’s implementation, we can identify the relevance of the capital requirements channel. We also document that the insurance industry crowds outs other investors in the new issuance of (high-yield) MBS.

Asymmetric information between buyers and suppliers leads to shorter term contracts. However, when longer duration contracts facilitate the exchange of relationship specific assets, the parties substitute short-term contracts with financial covenants in order to reduce moral hazard. Covenant restrictions are more prevalent when direct monitoring is costly and the products exchanged are highly specific. Finally, I find that buyers and suppliers are less likely to rely on financial covenants when financial statement reliability is low.},

Existing research has focused on using aggregate shocks to explain business cycles, arguing that individual ﬁrm shocks average out in the aggregate. I show that this argument breaks down if the distribution of ﬁrm sizes is fat-tailed, as documented empirically. The idiosyncratic movements of the largest 100 ﬁrms in the United States appear to explain about one-third of variations in output growth. This “granular” hypothesis suggests new directions for macroeconomic research, in particular that macroeconomic questions can be clariﬁed by looking at the behavior of large ﬁrms. This paper’s ideas and analytical results may also be useful for thinking about the ﬂuctuations of other economic aggregates, such as exports or the trade balance.},

Third, larger and more cyclical ﬁrms make forecasts closer to professionals, presumably reﬂecting their higher return to accuracy. Forecasts by more productive and older ﬁrms are also more similar to professional forecasts, implying forecasting ability is linked to management ability and experience.},

The theory is consistent with a rich set of facts on U.S. M\&A, including sorting among merging ﬁrms, a substantial merger premium and serial acquisition. It provides a sharp link between these facts and the nature of merger gains. At the micro-level, both complementarities between merging ﬁrms and productivity improvements of target ﬁrms are important in generating gains. At the macro-level, the model suggests a signiﬁcant beneﬁcial impact of M\&A on aggregate outcomes—the contribution to steady state output is 14\% and 4\% for consumption—which occurs through the reallocation of resources across ﬁrms and equilibrium effects on ﬁrm selection and new entrepreneurship. Nevertheless, the economy is not efﬁcient, suggesting a scope for policy improvements—a simple ﬂat tax on M\&A can raise steady state consumption as much as 2\% relative to the laissez-faire equilibrium. In short, the boundaries of the ﬁrm can matter for macroeconomic outcomes.},

Our analysis relies on three key features of the data: (1) on average, sales forecasts are unconditionally unbiased and the standard deviation of sales forecast errors is 17.0\% (2) managerial forecasts are conditionally biased, i.e., errors are autocorrelated with an AR(1) coefficient of 0.331, suggesting underreaction (3) while investment responds significantly to sales-forecast, the elasticity of firms’ capital stock to sales forecast is significantly smaller than one, at 0.485. We quantitatively interpret these findings through the lens of standard Q-model with distorted expectations. Distortions in expectation reduce firm value by 1.5\%, and lower aggregate productivity by 0.76\%. These findings remain unchanged when we introduce additional frictions (e.g., fixed adjustment costs, financial constraints) and behavioral biases (e.g., optimism).},

We formally show that these three facts are consistent with a model in which the underlying process is non-Gaussian, but forecasters fail to recognize this fully. We estimate this model and show it quantitatively explains our three facts. Finally, we show the model is consistent with evidence from an online forecasting experiment where the underlying process is non-Gaussian and the non-linearity in the momentum of stock returns.},

This divergence leads to a significant shift of deposits towards high-rate banks during monetary policy tightening, thereby reducing the sector’s overall capacity for maturity transformation and concentrating credit risk among high-rate banks. Our evidence suggest that technological advancements contribute to the divergence: high-rate banks operate primarily online and attract less sticky depositors.

	abstract = {The Great Recession was a deep downturn with long-lasting eﬀects on credit, employment and output. While narratives about its causes abound, the persistence of GDP below pre-crisis trends remains puzzling. We propose a simple persistence mechanism that can be quantiﬁed and combined with existing models. Our key premise is that agents don’t know the true distribution of shocks but use data to estimate it non-parametrically. Then, transitory events, especially extreme ones, generate persistent changes in beliefs and macro outcomes. Embedding this mechanism in a neoclassical model, we ﬁnd that it endogenously generates persistent drops in economic activity after tail events.},

The model matches well data on quantities, asset prices, and particularly the relations between quantities and prices, suggesting that variation in aggregate risk plays a significant role in some business cycles.

A rise in uncertainty raises shadow banking spreads, forcing ﬁnancial institutions to switch to collateral-intensive funding. Shadow banking collapses, liquidity provision shrinks, liquidity premia and discount rates rise, asset prices and investment fall.

	title = {A {Theory} of {Complexity} {Aversion}},
	abstract = {This paper proposes a tractable model of “complexity aversion”. The key ingredient is “ﬁrst order complexity aversion”: when people know they’re making a mistake (because the situation is complex) they experience dread, which is a utility loss proportional to the expected size of their error. This adds a new complexity aversion term to the traditional utility function. This simple enrichment has a host of consequences, which I illustrate in ﬁve examples. (i) If complexity aversion is high enough, the price of a good will be constant over time, even though the marginal cost might be variable, to avoid annoying the consumer with a complex price system. (ii) In the theory of optimal taxation, if complexity aversion is high enough, the optimal tax system is “simple”, e.g. just features a uniform tax rate rather than a di!erent tax rate for each good, as recommended by the traditional Ramsey model. (iii) Whereas the traditional model predicts that contracts should be indexed aggregate factors (e.g. on inﬂation, GDP, or the stock market), with enough complexity aversion, contracts are non-indexed, “simple”. (iv) As higher inﬂation leads to a more complex planning process, complexity aversion leads ﬁrst order cost of inﬂation, which much larger than the second order costs of the traditional model. (v) This in turn changes optimal monetary policy, which de facto should ensure zero inﬂation (more generally, zero deviation from the inﬂation target), to the exclusion of other goals, except in rare extreme circumstances such as an extreme recession. I ﬁnally discuss how using this model of complexity aversion will lead to a useful “behavioral mechanism design” theory, and more realistic—simpler—mechanisms.},

              This paper investigates the extent to which delayed expected loan loss recognition (
              DELR
              ) is associated with greater vulnerability of banks to three distinct dimensions of risk: (1) stock market liquidity risk, (2) downside tail risk of individual banks, and (3) codependence of downside tail risk among banks. We hypothesize that
              DELR
              increases vulnerability to downside risk by creating expected loss overhangs that threaten future capital adequacy and by degrading bank transparency, which increases financing frictions and opportunities for risk‐shifting. We find that
              DELR
              is associated with higher correlations between bank‐level illiquidity and both aggregate banking sector illiquidity and market returns (i.e., higher liquidity risks) during recessions, suggesting that high
              DELR
              banks as a group may simultaneously face elevated financing frictions and enhanced opportunities for risk‐shifting behavior in crisis periods. With respect to downside risk, we find that during recessions
              DELR
              is associated with significantly higher risk of individual banks suffering severe drops in their equity values, where this association is magnified for banks with low capital levels. Consistent with increased systemic risk, we find that
              DELR
              is associated with significantly higher codependence between downside risk of individual banks and downside risk of the banking sector. We theorize that downside risk vulnerability at the individual bank level can translate into systemic risk by virtue of
              DELR
              creating a common source of risk vulnerability across high
              DELR
              banks simultaneously, which leads to risk codependence among banks and systemic effects from banks acting as part of a herd.},

            We study how private equity buyouts create value in higher education, a sector with opaque product quality and intense government subsidy. With novel data on 88 private equity deals involving 994 schools, we show that buyouts lead to higher tuition and per-student debt. Exploiting loan limit increases, we find that private equity-owned schools better capture government aid. After buyouts, we observe lower education inputs, graduation rates, loan repayment rates, and earnings among graduates. Neither school selection nor student body changes fully explain the results. The results indicate that in a subsidized industry, maximizing value may not improve consumer outcomes.

For-profit enrollment increased from 0.2 percent to 9.1 percent of total enrollment in degree-granting schools from 1970 to 2009, and for-profit institutions account for the majority of enrollments in non-degree-granting postsecondary schools. We describe the schools, students, and programs in the for-profit higher education sector, its phenomenal recent growth, and its relationship to the federal and state governments. Using the 2004 to 2009 Beginning Postsecondary Students (BPS) longitudinal survey, we assess outcomes of a recent cohort of first-time undergraduates who attended for-profits relative to comparable students who attended community colleges or other public or private non-profit institutions. We find that relative to these other institutions, for-profits educate a larger fraction of minority, disadvantaged, and older students, and they have greater success at retaining students in their first year and getting them to complete short programs at the certificate and AA levels. But we also find that for-profit students end up with higher unemployment and “idleness” rates and lower earnings six years after entering programs than do comparable students from other schools and that, not surprisingly, they have far greater default rates on their loans.},

            In the United States, the average 40-year-old plant employs more than seven times as many workers as the typical plant 5 years or younger. In contrast, surviving plants in India and Mexico exhibit much slower growth, roughly doubling in size over the same age range. The divergence in plant dynamics suggests lower investments by Indian and Mexican plants in process efficiency, quality, and in accessing markets at home and abroad. In simple general equilibrium models, we find that the difference in life cycle dynamics could lower aggregate manufacturing productivity on the order of 25 percent in India and Mexico relative to the United States.},

Bullet train connectivity is also followed by a 1.6 pp decrease in incomedecreasing audit adjustments but no change in income-increasing audit adjustments. The negative relation between bullet train connectivity and audit quality is 1) stronger when bullet trains put greater competitive pressure on incumbent auditors and 2) weaker when clients demand high audit quality.

Similarly, when interest rates are low for too long, the persistent drag on bank profitability eventually outweighs banks’ initial capital gains, also stifling credit supply.

            We propose a theory of indebted demand, capturing the idea that large debt burdens lower aggregate demand, and thus the natural rate of interest. At the core of the theory is the simple yet underappreciated observation that borrowers and savers differ in their marginal propensities to save out of permanent income. Embedding this insight in a two-agent perpetual-youth model, we find that recent trends in income inequality and financial deregulation lead to indebted household demand, pushing down the natural rate of interest. Moreover, popular expansionary policies—such as accommodative monetary policy—generate a debt-financed short-run boom at the expense of indebted demand in the future. When demand is sufficiently indebted, the economy gets stuck in a debt-driven liquidity trap, or debt trap. Escaping a debt trap requires consideration of less conventional macroeconomic policies, such as those focused on redistribution or those reducing the structural sources of high inequality.},

During the farm land price boom and bust before the Great Depression, we find that credit availability directly inflated land prices. Credit also amplified the relationship between positive fundamentals and land prices, leading to greater indebtedness. When fundamentals soured, areas with higher credit availability suffered a greater fall in land prices and had more bank failures. Land prices and credit availability also remained disproportionately low for decades in these areas, suggesting that leverage might render temporary credit-induced booms and busts persistent. We draw lessons for regulatory policy. (JEL E31, G21, G28, N22, N52, Q12, Q14)},

The net worth of ﬁnancial intermediaries and the corporate sector are both state variables affecting the spread between intermediated and direct ﬁnance and the dynamics of real economic activity, such as investment, and ﬁnancing. The accumulation of net worth of intermediaries is slow relative to that of the corporate sector. The model is consistent with key stylized facts about macroeconomic downturns associated with a credit crunch, namely, their severity, their protractedness, and the fact that the severity of the credit crunch itself affects the severity and persistence of downturns. The model captures the tentative and halting nature of recoveries from crises.},

            Using U.S. data from 1929 to 2015, we show that elevated credit-market sentiment in year t − 2 is associated with a decline in economic activity in years t and t + 1. Underlying this result is the existence of predictable mean reversion in credit-market conditions. When credit risk is aggressively priced, spreads subsequently widen. The timing of this widening is, in turn, closely tied to the onset of a contraction in economic activity. Exploring the mechanism, we find that buoyant credit-market sentiment in year t − 2 also forecasts a change in the composition of external finance: net debt issuance falls in year t, while net equity issuance increases, consistent with the reversal in credit-market conditions leading to an inward shift in credit supply. Unlike much of the current literature on the role of financial frictions in macroeconomics, this article suggests that investor sentiment in credit markets can be an important driver of economic fluctuations.},

In addition, these firms’ total investments (R\&D expense plus capital expenditures) do not vary in response to earnings thresholds, which suggests that, on average, reductions in R\&D expense are offset by concurrent increases in capital expenditures. Lastly, our research design allows us to infer that the increased capital expenditures are largely R\&D investments that are capitalized instead of non-R\&D capital expenditures, suggesting that overall investments in R\&D are relatively unchanged.},

            We propose a new approach to studying the pass-through of credit expansion policies that focuses on frictions, such as asymmetric information, that arise in the interaction between banks and borrowers. We decompose the effect of changes in banks’ cost of funds on aggregate borrowing into the product of banks’ marginal propensity to lend (MPL) to borrowers and those borrowers’ marginal propensity to borrow (MPB), aggregated over all borrowers in the economy. We apply our framework by estimating heterogeneous MPBs and MPLs in the U.S. credit card market. Using panel data on 8.5 million credit cards and 743 credit limit regression discontinuities, we find that the MPB is declining in credit score, falling from 59\% for consumers with FICO scores below 660 to essentially zero for consumers with FICO scores above 740. We use a simple model of optimal credit limits to show that a bank’s MPL depends on a small number of parameters that can be estimated using our credit limit discontinuities. For the lowest FICO score consumers, higher credit limits sharply reduce profits from lending, limiting banks’ optimal MPL to these consumers. The negative correlation between MPB and MPL reduces the impact of changes in banks’ cost of funds on aggregate household borrowing, and highlights the importance of frictions in bank-borrower interactions for understanding the pass-through of credit expansions.},

Better-managed firms also birth better-managed plants and improve the performance of the plants they acquire. To explain these findings we build a model with two key elements. First, management is a combination of firm-level management ability (e.g. CEO quality), which can be transferred to all plants, and plant-level management practices, which can be changed through intangible investment (e.g. consulting or training). Second, management both raises productivity and also reduces the operational costs of dynamism: buying, selling, opening and closing plants. We structurally estimate the model on Census microdata, fitting our key dynamic moments, and then use it to establish three additional results. First, mergers and acquisitions raise economy-wide management and productivity by reallocating plants to firms with higher management ability. Banning M\&A would depress GDP and management by about 15\%. Second, greater product market competition improves both management and productivity by reallocating away from badly managed plants. Finally, management practices account for about 20\% of the cross-country productivity differences with the US.},

What are the implications of these changes for the information voters are exposed to and for their political choices? We study these questions using the staggered introduction of Craigslist (CL)—the world’s largest online platform for classiﬁed advertising—across U.S. counties between 1995 and 2009. This setting allows us to separate the effect of competition for classiﬁed advertising from other changes brought about by the Internet, and to compare newspapers that relied more or less heavily on classiﬁed ads ex ante. We ﬁnd that, following the entry of CL, local newspapers reliant on classiﬁed ads experienced a signiﬁcant decline in the number of management and newsroom staff, including in the number of editors covering politics. These organizational changes led to a reduction in news coverage of politics and resulted in a decline in newspaper readership, particularly among readers with high political interest. Finally, we document that reduced exposure to local political news was associated with an increase in partisan voting and increased entry and success of ideologically extreme candidates in congressional elections. Taken together, our ﬁndings shed light on the determinants of the decline of print media and on its broader implications for democratic politics.},

The degree of individual-level over-reaction and the extent of inelasticity vary with the composition of traders, and with the informativeness of new information. More generally, unlike mislearning from fundamentals, mislearning from prices (i) generates a two-way feedback between prices and beliefs that can provide an arbitrarily large amount of ampliﬁcation and (ii) can rationalize both over-reaction and more inelastic markets. The two classes of biases are not mutually exclusive. Instead, they interact in very natural ways, and mislearning from prices can vastly amplify mislearning from fundamentals.},

We exploit a 2016 non-aggression pact between gangs to examine how collusion affects extortion in areas where gangs previously competed. While the pact led to a large reduction in competition and violence, we ﬁnd that it increased the amount paid in extortion by approximately 20\%. Much of this increase was passed through to retailers and consumers: retailers experienced an increase in delivery fees, leading to an increase in consumer prices. In particular, we ﬁnd an increase in prices for pharmaceutical drugs and a corresponding increase in hospital visits for chronic illnesses. The results point to an unintended consequence of policies that reduce competition between criminal organisations.},

In standard precautionary savings models, these households should not only display higher marginal propensities to consume (MPCs) but also higher future consumption growth. In contrast, we see from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics that such “hand-to-mouth” households do not display higher growth in spending. They also exhibit greater volatility of spending and adjust their spending to a greater extent through the number of categories consumed. Consistent with a role for preference heterogeneity, the panel data show that it is persistent differences across households, not current assets, that predict low consumption growth and other spending differences for the hand-tomouth households. To identify the extent of preference heterogeneity, we consider the model of Kaplan and Violante with both liquid and illiquid assets, but allow heterogeneity in preferences. To match the data, many poor hand-to-mouth must be relatively impatient and have a high inter-temporal elasticity of substitution. The model shows that preferences predominantly explain the higher MPCs for low-asset households. Preference heterogeneity notably increases the spending impact of ﬁscal transfers, but only if targeted, while reducing that from interest rate cuts.},

Consistent with the survey evidence, an increase in pessimism generates upward biases in unemployment and inﬂation forecasts and lowers economic activity. The underlying belief distortions reduce aggregate demand and propagate through frictional goods and labour markets. As a by-product of the analysis, solution techniques that preserve the effects of time-varying belief distortions in the class of linear solutions are developed.},

When return guarantees bind, they constrain this redistribution, reducing it by 15 basis points per year on average. Purchases of new contracts react to this reduced inter-cohort redistribution: in the cross-section of insurers, purchases of new contracts decrease when the average guaranteed return in legacy contracts is higher. Moreover, the effect is stronger for single premium contracts, which tend to have a wealthier, hence more sophisticated clientele.},

We show how our measure differs from price informativeness and use it to document a new fact: data about large high-growth firms is becoming increasingly abundant, relative to data about other firms. Our structural model offers an explanation for this data divergence: large high-growth firms’ data became more valuable, as big firms got bigger and growth magnified the effect of these changes in size.},

            This paper examines why private firms choose to be financially transparent or opaque by conducting a field experiment with more than 25,000 firms in Germany. We inform a randomly chosen set of firms about a disclosure option that allows eligible firms to restrict access to their otherwise publicly available financial statements. We also vary the messaging in subtle ways to induce experimental variation in the probability that firms take transacting (capital providers or customers and suppliers) versus non‐transacting stakeholders (competitors or general interest parties) into consideration when making their filing decision. Based on each firm's actual filing decision, we find that treated firms are 15\% more likely to restrict access to their financial statements. This intention‐to‐treat effect is persistent and concentrated among firms that should derive lower net benefits from disclosure (smaller, more mature firms in less capital‐intensive industries). These findings indicate that informational constraints affect firms’ disclosure practice. Additionally, we show that the treatment effect is almost 40\% larger for firms that have a higher, exogenously induced, probability of considering non‐transacting stakeholders when making their disclosure decision. By analyzing subsequent firm activity and complementary survey evidence, we also provide suggestive evidence that disclosure requirements put an undue burden on very small private firms.},

	abstract = {A wide body of empirical evidence ﬁnds that approximately 25 percent of ﬁscal stimulus payments (e.g., tax rebates) are spent on nondurable household consumption in the quarter that they are received. To interpret this fact, we develop a structural economic model where households can hold two assets: a low-return liquid asset (e.g., cash, checking account) and a high-return illiquid asset that carries a transaction cost (e.g., housing, retirement account). The optimal life-cycle pattern of portfolio choice implies that many households in the model are “wealthy hand-to-mouth”: they hold little or no liquid wealth despite owning sizable quantities of illiquid assets. Therefore, they display large propensities to consume out of additional transitory income, and small propensities to consume out of news about future income. We document the existence of such households in data from the Survey of Consumer Finances. A version of the model parameterized to the 2001 tax rebate episode yields consumption responses to ﬁscal stimulus payments that are in line with the evidence, and an order of magnitude larger than in the standard “one-asset” framework. The model’s nonlinearities with respect to the rebate size and the prevailing aggregate economic conditions have implications for policy design.},

In this setting, the manager's reporting bias reduces the value relevance of the manager's report; that is, it adds noise to the report. Through comparative static results, our model yields insights into factors that affect the slope and intercept terms in a regression of price on earnings. Specifically, we find that the information content of the manager's report, as captured by the earnings slope coefficient, falls as the private cost to the manager of biasing reports falls, and as the uncertainty about the manager's objective increases. We also find that the magnitude of the adjustment for the expected amount of bias, as captured by the absolute value of the intercept, falls as the uncertainty about the manager's objective increases. Finally, to highlight conditions under which managers would lobby to retain an option to bias reports (i.e., retain reporting flexibility), we analyze the effect of the option to bias on the manager's welfare. For example, we show that the ex ante benefit from biasing the report is positive if there is sufficient uncertainty about the manager's reporting objective.},

Speciﬁcally, we provide conditions under which a regulator, seeking to maximize the total amount of information provided to investors via both mandatory and voluntary disclosures, would mandate less informative and more conservative ﬁnancial reports even in the absence of any direct costs of increasing informativeness. This result is robust to allowing the ﬁrm to make reports more informative and to imposing a nondisclosure cost or penalty on the ﬁrm. The results and comparative statics analysis contribute to our understanding of interactions between mandatory reporting and voluntary disclosure and demonstrate a novel beneﬁt to setting accounting standards that mandate imperfectly informative reports.},

The accounting system provides information about the value of the collateral.

I examine how the informativeness and the bias of the optimal system are determined by investors' inspection cost, the degree of incentive alignment between the manager and investors, and the prior belief that the project is pro table. I  nd that a mis-aligned manager's system is informative only when the market prior is pessimistic and is always positively biased. As investors' inspection cost decreases, this bias decreases and the optimal system becomes more conservative. In contrast, a well-aligned manager's system is fully revealing when investors' inspection cost is high, and is counter-cyclical to the market belief when the inspection cost is low: It is positively (negatively) biased when the market belief is pessimistic (optimistic). I explore the extent to which the results generalize to a case with managerial manipulation and discuss the implications for investment e ciency. Overall, the analysis describes the complex interactions among determinants of  rm disclosures and governance, and o ers explanations for the mixed empirical results in this area.},

The ﬁrm can signal its private information about the fundamental by retaining a fraction of the shares. In addition, the ﬁrm can commit to disclosing information according to a set of accounting rules chosen ex ante. Information disclosure reduces signaling cost so that perfect disclosure is optimal. When perfect disclosure is impossible, the optimal accounting rule features a lower bound and a summary statistic of the fundamental. The interpretation of the lower bound is consistent with accounting conservatism, and the statistic summarizes the information most relevant to the ﬁrm's valuation. The justiﬁcation for accounting conservatism relies on the existence of information asymmetry and the infeasibility of perfect accounting disclosure. This is consistent with the conjecture of LaFond and Watts (2008) that information asymmetry calls for accounting conservatism.},

	abstract = {We examine how uncertain veracity of external news influences investor beliefs, market prices and corporate disclosures. Despite assuming independence between the news’ veracity and the firm’s endowment with private information, we find that favorable news is taken “with a grain of salt” in equilibrium—more precisely, perceived as less likely veracious—which reinforces investor beliefs that nondisclosing managers are hiding disadvantageous information. Hence more favorable external news could paradoxically lead to lower market valuation. That is, amid management silence, stock prices may be non-monotonic in the positivity of external news. In line with mounting empirical evidence, our analysis implies asymmetric price reactions to news and price declines following firm disclosures. We further predict that external news that is more likely veracious may increase or decrease the probability of disclosure and link these effects to empirically observable characteristics.},

Each division can increase the total surplus generated through interdivisional trade by making costly relationship-specific investments. The terms of trade are determined through negotiations between the two managers. Managerial compensation contracts are linear functions of divisional profit and firm-wide profit. If managers are compensated solely on the basis of their divisional profits, they invest less than the first-best amounts. While compensation contracts based on firm-wide profits alone can induce first-best investments, they impose extra risk on risk-averse managers. Therefore, we find that optimal linear compensation contracts will contain both divisional and firm-wide components. Our analysis also identifies a feature of negotiated transfer pricing, namely interdivisional risk sharing, and characterizes its impact on the design of optimal contracts.},

This conﬂict may give rise to stable (and economically meaningful) pooling equilibria for startup ﬁrms. More established ﬁrms, with access to multiple signals, can always realize both of these objectives but may still decide to forego investor effort if eliciting it would require them to deviate substantially from the cost-minimizing signal mix. In comparison with otherwise identical pure-exchange settings (with passive investors), we ﬁnd that the potential for investors to be active always increases the signaling cost in case of noncontractible investor effort, whereas the effect is ambiguous if investor effort is contractible. At the same time, we identify conditions under which signaling is welfare-enhancing as it helps guide investors’ effort towards more promising ventures.},

Speciﬁc investments increase eﬃciency at the margin. This expands the scale of operations and thereby adds to the compensation risk borne by the managers. Accounting for this investment/risk link overturns key ﬁndings from prior incomplete contracting studies. We ﬁnd that, if the investing manager has full bargaining power vis-a-vis the other manager, he will underinvest relative to the benchmark of contractible investments; with equal bargaining power, however, he may overinvest. The reason is that the investing manager internalizes only his own share of the investmentinduced risk premium (we label this a “risk transfer”), whereas the principal internalizes both managers’ incremental risk premia. We show that high pay-performance sensitivity (PPS) reduces the managers’ incentives to invest in relationship-speciﬁc assets. The optimal PPS thus trades oﬀ investment and eﬀort incentives.},

The CEO has control over the properties of the collected information if the project is “novel” in the sense that it explores a new technology, business concept, or market. We ﬁnd that only a board with suﬃciently high anti-approval bias can discipline the CEO’s empire-building tendency and opportunistic information collection and reporting. A board with this bias, however, underinvests in projects that are not novel. From the shareholders’ perspective, the board that maximizes ﬁrm value is either biased against approval or neutral (has interests aligned with those of the shareholders). Boards with greater expertise are more likely to be biased but their bias is less severe. We also predict that boards choose not to collect information on their own and overinvest in innovations.},

	abstract = {Empirical evidence suggests that firms often manipulate reported numbers to avoid debt covenant violations. We study how a firm’s ability to manipulate reports affects the terms of its debt contracts and the resulting investment and manipulation decisions that the firm implements. Our model generates novel empirical predictions regarding the use and the level of debt covenant, the interest rate, the efficiency of investment decisions, and the likelihood of covenant violations. For example, the model predicts that the optimal debt contract for firms with relatively strong (weak) corporate governance (i.e., cost of manipulation) induces overinvestment (underinvestment). Moreover, for firms with strong (weak) corporate governance, an increase in corporate governance quality leads to tighter (looser) covenant, more (less) frequent covenant violations and lower (higher) interest rate. Our model highlights that the interest rate, which is a common proxy for the cost of debt, neither accounts for the distortion of investment efficiency nor the expected manipulation costs arising under debt financing. We propose a measure of cost of debt capital that accounts for these effects.},

Risk-averse business unit managers each engage in general (stand-alone) operations and invest in joint projects that beneﬁt their own and other divisions. Which of the managers should have the authority to choose these investments? With scalable investments, we show that decision rights should be bundled in the hands of the manager facing the more volatile environment. With discrete (lumpy) investments, on the other hand, decision rights should be split between the managers, provided they face comparable levels of uncertainty in their general operations. Splitting decision rights better leverages the inherent investment complementarity, counter to conventional wisdom. Our model generates empirical predictions for the equilibrium association of organizational structure and managers’ incentive contracts: bundling of decision rights results in pay-performance sensitivity (PPS) divergence across divisions; splitting them results in PPS convergence.},

	abstract = {This paper addresses the question of what determines where in a ﬁrm’s hierarchy investment decisions are made. We present a simple model of a CEO and a division manager to analyze when the CEO will choose to allocate decision-making authority over an investment decision to a division manager. Both the CEO and the division manager have private information regarding the proﬁt maximizing investment level. Because the division manager is assumed to have a preference for “empire”, neither manager will communicate her information fully to the other. We show that the probability of delegation increases with the importance of the division manager’s information and decreases with the importance of the CEO’s information. A somewhat counterintuitive result is that, in some circumstances, increases in agency problems result in increased willingness of the CEO to delegate the decision. We also characterize situations in which the CEO prefers to commit to an allocation of authority ex ante, instead of deciding based on her private information. Finally, even though the division manager is biased toward larger investments, we show that under certain conditions, the average investment will be smaller when the decision is delegated. These results help explain some ﬁndings in the empirical literature. A number of other empirical implications are developed.},

This study develops a model that endogenizes the timing decision of analysts and analyzes their equilibrium timing strategies. In the model, analysts face a trade-off between the timeliness and the precision of their forecasts. The model intro duces a timing game with two analysts, derives and analyzes its unique pure strategies equilibrium, and provides new empirical predictions about the precision and timing of analysts' forecasts. The equilibrium has one of two patterns: either the times of the analysts' forecasts cluster, or there is a separation in the times of the forecasts. The less informed and less similar the analysts are, the more likely it is that they forecast at different points in time. All else equal, analysts with a higher precision of initial private information tend to forecast earlier, and analysts with a higher learning ability tend to forecast later.},

Consistent with this prediction, we ﬁnd that vega gives CEOs incentives to increase their ﬁrms’ total risk by increasing systematic risk but not idiosyncratic risk. Collectively, our results suggest that stock options might not always encourage managers to pursue projects that are primarily characterized by idiosyncratic risk when projects with systematic risk are available as an alternative.},

In addition, in certain cases, tax avoidance necessitates changes to ‘real’ activity. While there is evidence of income shifting, the literature is not settled on the extent to which it occurs.

	abstract = {No government can announce a tax system and then rely on taxpayers' sense of duty to remit what is owed. Some dutiful people will undoubtedly pay what they owe, but many others will not. Over time the ranks of the dutiful will shrink, as they see how they are being taken advantage of by the others. Thus, paying taxes must be made a legal responsibility of citizens, with penalties attendant on noncompliance. But even in the face of those penalties, substantial tax evasion exists. Tax evasion is widespread, always has been, and probably always will be. This essay reviews what is known about the magnitude, nature, and determinants of tax evasion, with an emphasis on the U.S. income tax. It then places this information into a conceptual context, examining various models and theories, and considers policy implications.},

We label this measure the "long-run cash effective tax rate." We use the long-run cash effective tax rate to examine (1) the extent to which some firms are able to avoid taxes over periods as long as ten years, and (2) how predictive one-year tax rates are for long-run tax avoidance. In our sample of 2,077 firms, we find there is considerable cross-sectional variation in tax avoidance. For example, approximately one-fourth of our sample firms are able to maintain longrun cash effective tax rates below 20 percent, compared to a sample mean tax rate of approximately 30 percent. We also find that annual cash effective tax rates are not very good predictors of long-run cash effective tax rates and, thus, are not accurate proxies for long-run tax avoidance. While there is some evidence of persistence in annual cash effective tax rates, the persistence is asymmetric. Low annual cash effective tax rates are more persistent than are high annual cash effective tax rates. An initial examination of characteristics of firms successful at keeping their cash effective tax rates low over long periods shows that they are well spread across industries but with some clustering.},

The effect of internal information quality on tax avoidance is stronger for firms in which information is likely to play a more important role. For example, firms with greater coordination needs because of a dispersed geographical presence benefit more from high internal information quality. Similarly, firms operating in a more uncertain environment benefit more from the quality of their internal information in helping them to reduce ETRs. In addition, we provide evidence that high internal information quality allows firms to achieve lower ETRs without increasing the risk of their tax strategies (as measured by ETR volatility). Overall, our study contributes to the literature on tax avoidance by providing evidence that the internal information environment of the firm is important for understanding its tax avoidance outcomes.},

We show that these magnitudes are overstated due to researchers’ misunderstanding of the accounting treatment of indirectly-owned foreign affiliates in the U.S. international economic accounts data. Our work has far-reaching implications as all country-level MNE data must apply some accounting convention that can make international comparisons difficult. We explain how this accounting treatment leads to double counting of foreign income and to its misattribution to incorrect jurisdictions. We demonstrate a simple correction, and show that the correction significantly reduces the magnitude of the BEPS estimates. For instance, our correction reduces an estimate of the U.S. fiscal effects of BEPS from 30-45\% to 4-8\% of corporate tax revenues lost to BEPS activity of MNEs (Clausing 2016).},

Domestic and foreign policy makers are increasingly concerned with the effect of income shifting on dwindling tax revenues, however, extant research on income shifting by U.S. multinational enterprises is mixed. We address the disconnect between the academic literature and the policy maker’s perceptions by examining the extent of multijurisdictional income shifting by U.S. multinational companies. We directly address conﬂicting results in extant literature and show that using either multiperiod proxies or instrumental variables overcomes weaknesses of annual proxies in this setting. Our tests show that U.S. companies have become more active at shifting income out of the United States as the regulatory costs of shifting have changed. Holding tax rate differences between U.S. and foreign jurisdictions constant, our empirical estimates suggest that our sample of 380 corporations with low average foreign tax rates collectively shifts approximately \$10 billion of additional income out of the United States annually during 2005–2009 relative to 1998–2002 due to varying regulatory costs of shifting.},

            We examine how U.S. individuals respond to regulation intended to reduce offshore tax evasion. The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) requires foreign financial institutions to report information to the U.S. government regarding U.S. account holders. We first document an average \$7.8 billion to \$15.3 billion decrease in equity foreign portfolio investment to the United States from tax‐haven countries after FATCA implementation, consistent with a decrease in “round‐tripping” investments attributable to U.S. investors’ offshore tax evasion. When testing total worldwide investment out of financial accounts in tax havens post‐FATCA, we find an average decline of \$56.6 billion to \$78.0 billion. We next provide evidence of other important consequences of this regulation, including increased expatriations of U.S. citizens and greater investment in alternative assets not subject to FATCA reporting, such as residential real estate and artwork. Our study contributes to both the academic literature and policy analysis on regulation, tax evasion, and crime.},

We also discuss emerging topics such as the interrelation between firms’ tax avoidance and real outcomes, advances in research design, and environmental-related tax policies.

The i?2, which averages approximately 5\% to 9\%, measures the proportion of total information incorporated in share prices annually that is associated with earnings announcements. We conclude that the average quarterly announcement is associated with approximately 1\% to 2\% of total annual information, thus providing a modest but not overwhelmin amount of incremental information to the market. The results are consistent with the view that the primary economic role of reported earnings is not to provide timely new information to the share market. By inference, that role lies elsewhere, for example, in settling debt and compensation contracts and in disciplining prior information, including more timely managerial disclosures of information originating in the firm's accounting system. The relative informativeness of earnings announcements is a concave function of size.

In capital market exchanges, accounting information ameliorates information asymmetry, thereby enabling price discovery and reducing trading costs. We argue that accounting information is useful in stewardship and valuation despite its limitations. For pedagogical purposes, we first examine the attributes of accounting earnings as produced and received in the market without delving into how the preparers’ incentives influence the fineness of information produced or its properties. Readers can view this discussion as a reduced-form analysis of accounting earnings and their relation to stock prices. After mapping this landscape, we then present a strategic analysis of accounting earnings. This analysis recognizes that accounting information affects users’ and producers’ decisions, which, combined with self-interested behavior, influences the properties of the accounting information produced and affects how it is used in valuation, contracting, and firms’ investment decisions. Shareholder value is our primary efficiency measure, and we also discuss regulatory, social, and contract efficiency. We note that shareholder value maximization and stakeholder protection are not at odds and that accounting information facilitates firms’ commitment to stakeholder protection, which, in turn, leads to more value creation for shareholders.},

Theory posits that product market competition can cause firms to increase their disclosure of innovation to deter product market competitors. Consistent with this reasoning, we find that patent applicants in more competitive industries voluntarily accelerate their patent disclosures, which are credibly disclosed via the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Our inferences are robust to using changes in industry-level import tariffs as sources of plausibly exogenous variation in product market competition in difference-in-differences designs. Consistent with patent disclosure deterring product market competitors, we find that timelier patent disclosures are more strongly associated with declines in the similarity of competitors’ products than are less timely patent disclosures. In total, our results suggest that product market competition increases patent disclosure timeliness, which is consistent with firms using the disclosure of innovation to deter product market competition.},

	abstract = {We examine the relation between manager horizon and discretionary disclosure, using patenting as a measure of disclosure. Patenting reflects, in part, a manager’s decision to disclose the successful outcome of research and development (R\&D). When a firm invests in R\&D but does not patent, investors are unsure whether this reflects a failed R\&D project or the manager choosing not to patent. We suggest that investors’ beliefs about a manager’s horizon—whether the manager seeks to maximize short-term stock price or long-term profits—moderates their reactions. When investors believe a manager’s horizon is short, they expect the manager to disclose successful outcomes and therefore discount nondisclosure more. We predict that managers will patent more per dollar of R\&D spending when their horizons are short and that investors will discount the value of nondisclosing firms more when they believe the manager’s horizon is short. We find evidence consistent with these predictions.},

These ﬁndings suggest patent disclosures generate both spillover beneﬁts and proprietary costs. Our ﬁndings provide justiﬁcation for patent disclosure requirements by demonstrating positive externalities: rivals' disclosures facilitate a ﬁrm's innovation. However, we also highlight that mandatory patent disclosures can impose proprietary costs on ﬁrms. These results broadly contribute to our understanding of the real effects of disclosure, such that forcing ﬁrms to share proprietary information can be privately costly but beneﬁcial to other ﬁrms.},

            I examine how mandatory extraction payment disclosures (EPD)—a policy solution intended to discourage corporate payment avoidance in the oil, gas, and mining industries—affect fiscal revenue contributions and investments by multinational firms in foreign host countries. Using the staggered adoption of EPD across firms headquartered in Europe and Canada, I find that disclosing companies increase their payments to host governments, decrease investments, and obtain fewer extraction licenses relative to non‐disclosing competitors. These effects are stronger for firms that face a high risk of public shaming, operate in corrupt host countries, and have a high exposure to bribery‐prone payments, suggesting that EPD increases the reputational cost of corporate behavior that could be perceived as exploitative. The resulting reallocation of investments from disclosing to non‐disclosing firms reduces drilling productivity and resource production in host countries, consistent with uneven disclosure regulation distorting capital allocation.},

	abstract = {Individual outcomes are highly correlated with group average outcomes, a fact often interpreted as a causal peer effect. Without covariates, however, outcome-on-outcome peer effects are vacuous, either unity or, if the average is deﬁned as a leave-out mean, determined by a generic intraclass correlation coefﬁcient. When pre-determined peer characteristics are introduced as covariates in a model linking individual outcomes with group averages, the question of whether peer effects or social spillovers exist is econometrically identical to that of whether a 2SLS estimator using group dummies to instrument individual characteristics differs from OLS estimates of the effect of these characteristics. The interpretation of results from models that rely solely on chance variation in peer groups is therefore complicated by bias from weak instruments. With systematic variation in group composition, the weak IV issue falls away, but the resulting 2SLS estimates can be expected to exceed the corresponding OLS estimates as a result of measurement error and for other reasons unrelated to social effects. Research designs that manipulate peer characteristics in a manner unrelated to individual characteristics provide the most compelling evidence on the nature of social spillovers. As an empirical matter, designs of this sort have mostly uncovered little in the way of socially signiﬁcant causal effects.},

Despite the market volatility and uncertainty at the onset of COVID-19, executives’ predictions of the one-day price reaction are directionally correct in two-thirds of cases. Further, executives’ short-window expectation errors predict returns. Following their companies’ reports, executives trade against the market in line with their initial error, and stock prices largely converge to their expectations over the subsequent 100 trading days. Collectively, our results provide novel evidence of executives’ superior ability to anticipate how the market prices information in quarterly financial reports, even in periods of extraordinary change.},

The articles are available for thousands of firms on a quarterly basis, many of which previously received little or no media attention. We use AP’s staggered implementation of robo-journalism to examine the effects of media synthesis and dissemination, in a setting where the articles are devoid of private information and are largely exogenous to the firm’s earnings news and disclosure choices.

We find no evidence that the articles improve or impede the speed of price discovery.

The model predicts that if the manager can choose the subset of users to receive the information, then the manager may gather more precise information. The paper identifies conditions under which a regime that allows managers to grant access to information selectively maximizes aggregate information. Strikingly, this happens when the objectives of managers and users are sufficiently misaligned. This finding is robust to variations of the model, such as information acquisition cost, unobservable precision, sequential noisy actions taken by the users, and delayed choice of the subset of users in ‘‘the know.’’ These results call into doubt the common belief that forcing managers to provide unrestricted access to information to all potential users is always beneficial.},

In our model, the ﬁrm's primary but nonexclusive concern is to induce beliefs that exceed a threshold. Such thresholds arise in numerous contexts, including investing decisions, liquidation/continuation choices, covenants, audits, impairments, listing requirements, index inclusion, credit ratings, analyst recommendations, and stress tests. The optimal reporting system is characterized by informative good reports when the threshold is high and, potentially, uninformative reports when the threshold is low. Under an optimal impairment-type reporting system, the likelihood of reported impairments and the information content of non-impairment reports both increase in the probability of the ﬁrm observing private information. We provide a novel motivation for the quiet period around an IPO and empirical predictions relating the probability of discretionary disclosure to the properties of ﬁnancial reports. In extensions, we consider disclosure mandates, report manipulation, endogenous thresholds, and alternative payoff functions.},

We explore this question by leveraging a unique dataset of more than 310,000 detailed individual resumes for the 36 largest audit firms to identify audit firms’ employment of AI workers. We provide a first look into the AI workforce within the auditing sector. AI workers tend to be male and relatively young and hold mostly but not exclusively technical degrees. Importantly, AI is a centralized function within the firm, with workers concentrating in a handful of teams and geographic locations. Our results show that investing in AI helps improve audit quality, reduces fees, and ultimately displaces human auditors, although the effect on labor takes several years to materialize. Specifically, a one-standard-deviation change in recent AI investments is associated with a 5.0\% reduction in the likelihood of an audit restatement, a 0.9\% drop in audit fees, and a reduction in the number of accounting employees that reaches 3.6\% after three years and 7.1\% after four years. Our empirical analyses are supported by in-depth interviews with 17 audit partners representing the eight largest U.S. public accounting firms, which show that (1) AI is developed centrally; (2) AI is widely used in audit; and (3) the primary goal for using AI in audit is improved quality, followed by efficiency.},

            Using the implementation of the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval (EDGAR) system from 1993 to 1996 as a shock to information dissemination technologies, we examine how a significant reduction in disclosure processing costs affects the real economy. We find that the EDGAR implementation leads to an increase in corporate investment and that this effect is concentrated in value firms. We provide evidence that improved equity financing and enhanced managerial incentives are likely the underlying mechanisms. Specifically, the EDGAR implementation leads to an increase in a firm's stock liquidity, a decrease in the cost of equity capital, and an increase in the level of equity financing. Consistent with the monitoring effect of broad information dissemination, the EDGAR implementation leads to an increase in a firm's operating performance. Our findings suggest that it is important to consider information dissemination beyond information production when examining the real effects of corporate disclosures.},

            Using proprietary data from AngelList Talent, we study how startup job seekers’ search and application behavior changed during the COVID-19 downturn.

Our results indicate that disclosing diversity scores in job postings leads jobseekers to click on firms with higher diversity scores, with such effects varying across jobseeker demographics. A follow‐up survey provides evidence on potential explanations for why jobseekers value diversity information. We then examine how jobseekers’ preferences for diversity relate to disclosure choices under the U.S. SEC Human Capital Disclosure requirement. We find that firms in industries characterized by higher jobseeker responsiveness to diversity information tend to voluntarily disclose diversity metrics in their 10‐Ks under these new disclosure requirements.},

            We investigate the effects of financial reporting on current employee job search, that is, whether firms' public financial reports cause their employees to reevaluate their jobs and consider leaving. We develop theory for why current employees use earnings announcements (EAs) to inform job search decisions, and empirically investigate job search based on employees' activity on a popular job market website. We find that job search by current employees increases significantly during EA weeks, especially when employees are more mobile and when their information frictions are greater. We also find that employees use EAs to update their expectations about their employers' economic prospects, consistent with learning, and some evidence that positive announcements elicit less search. Our paper contributes to the burgeoning labor and accounting literature by providing among the first evidence closely linking financial reports to employee learning and job search.},

When the fraud is revealed, firms shed workers, unwinding this abnormal growth and resulting in most of the negative wage consequences.

            Using proprietary data from AngelList Talent, we study how startup job seekers’ search and application behavior changed during the COVID-19 downturn. We find that workers shifted their searches and applications away from less-established startups and toward more-established ones, even within the same individual over time. At the firm level, this shift was not offset by an influx of new job seekers. Less-established startups experienced a relative decline in the quantity and quality of applications, ultimately affecting their hiring. Our findings uncover a flight-to-safety channel in the labor market that may amplify the procyclical nature of entrepreneurial activities.},

            We examine how information about the diversity of a potential employer's workforce affects individuals’ job‐seeking behavior. We embed a field experiment in job recommendation emails from a leading career advice agency in the United States. The experimental treatment involves highlighting a diversity metric to jobseekers. Our results indicate that disclosing diversity scores in job postings leads jobseekers to click on firms with higher diversity scores, with such effects varying across jobseeker demographics. A follow‐up survey provides evidence on potential explanations for why jobseekers value diversity information. We then examine how jobseekers’ preferences for diversity relate to disclosure choices under the U.S. SEC Human Capital Disclosure requirement. We find that firms in industries characterized by higher jobseeker responsiveness to diversity information tend to voluntarily disclose diversity metrics in their 10‐Ks under these new disclosure requirements.},

            We investigate the effects of financial reporting on current employee job search, that is, whether firms' public financial reports cause their employees to reevaluate their jobs and consider leaving. We develop theory for why current employees use earnings announcements (EAs) to inform job search decisions, and empirically investigate job search based on employees' activity on a popular job market website. We find that job search by current employees increases significantly during EA weeks, especially when employees are more mobile and when their information frictions are greater. We also find that employees use EAs to update their expectations about their employers' economic prospects, consistent with learning, and some evidence that positive announcements elicit less search. Our paper contributes to the burgeoning labor and accounting literature by providing among the first evidence closely linking financial reports to employee learning and job search.},

Our data say that 20 percent of full workdays will be supplied from home after the pandemic ends, compared with just 5 percent before. We develop evidence on five reasons for this large shift: better-than-expected WFH experiences, new investments in physical and human capital that enable WFH, greatly diminished stigma associated with WFH, lingering concerns about crowds and contagion risks, and a pandemic-driven surge in technological innovations that support WFH. We also use our survey data to project three consequences: First, employees will enjoy large benefits from greater remote work, especially those with higher earnings. Second, the shift to WFH will directly reduce spending in major city centers by at least 5-10 percent relative to the pre-pandemic situation. Third, our data on employer plans and the relative productivity of WFH imply a 5 percent productivity boost in the post-pandemic economy due to re-optimized working arrangements. Only one-fifth of this productivity gain will show up in conventional productivity measures, because they do not capture the time savings from less commuting.},

            I examine the effects of occupational licensing on the quality of certified public accountants (CPAs). I exploit the staggered adoption of the 150‐hour rule, which increases the educational requirements for a CPA license. The analysis shows that the rule decreases the number of entrants into the profession, reducing both low‐ and high‐quality candidates. Labor market proxies for quality find no difference between 150‐hour rule CPAs and the rest. Moreover, rule CPAs exit public accounting at similar rates and have comparable writing quality to their nonrule counterparts. Overall, these findings are consistent with the theoretical argument that increases in licensing requirements restrict the supply of entrants and do little to improve quality in the labor market.},

Further building on survey responses, we demonstrate that strategic disclosure during CBA renegotiation intensifies when the union is less exposed to right to work laws; when strategic disclosure can significantly influence CBA renegotiations; and when CBAs encompass a larger number of employees. Lastly, we find that strategic reviews associate with lower equity market returns, and that this association does not differ for non-strategic reviews. Moreover, no reversal is observed in market returns following the negotiations.

	abstract = {An AI analyst trained to digest corporate disclosures, industry trends, and macroeconomic indicators surpasses most analysts in stock return predictions. Nevertheless, humans win “Man vs. Machine” when institutional knowledge is crucial, e.g., involving intangible assets and ﬁnancial distress. AI wins when information is transparent but voluminous. Humans provide signiﬁcant incremental value in “Man + Machine,” which also substantially reduces extreme errors. Analysts catch up with machines after “alternative data” become available if their employers build AI capabilities. Documented synergies between humans and machines inform how humans can leverage their advantage for better adaptation to the growing AI prowess.},

	abstract = {Policymakers fear artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) will disrupt labor markets, especially for highskilled workers. We investigate this concern using novel, task-speciﬁc data for security analysts. Exploiting variation in AI’s power across stocks, we show analysts with portfolios that are more exposed to AI are more likely to reallocate eﬀorts to soft skills, shift coverage towards low AI stocks, and even leave the profession. Analyst departures disproportionately occur among highly accurate analysts, leaving for non-research jobs. Reallocating eﬀorts toward tasks that rely on social skills improve consensus forecasts. However, increased exposure to AI reduces the novelty in analysts’ research which reduces compensation.},

	abstract = {This study examines the impact of using artificial intelligence (AI) on audit firms. We exploit the staggered job postings requiring AI skills at audit office locations across the United States as a proxy for the use of AI at local audit offices. First, we find that relative to audit offices that do not yet post any AI jobs, audit offices that post such jobs experience a 19\% increase in the number of auditor jobs. Second, after posting AI jobs, these audit offices are also less likely to demand hard and technical computer/software skills, and more likely to demand soft and nontechnical skills for the same auditor job in the same audit office. Last, we find that these audit offices do not lower audit fees but significantly reduces the percentage of clients with adverse restatements and audit lag. Overall, our evidence indicates that using AI does not replace auditor jobs but changes the skill requirements in auditor jobs and improves audit quality.},
